The study investigates the AgriVoltaic Systems Development (AVSD), which allow for simultaneous electricity generation and crop growth on the same land. A key finding from quantitative research is the significant reduction in water evaporation due to AVSD. The study examined soil and pan surface evaporation under Bare soil (control treatment) (CK), Concentrated-lighting Agrivoltaic System (CAS), and Even-lighting Agrivoltaic System (EAS), using SPSS software for analysis. Results showed that both CAS and EAS notably decreased water evaporation (21-33% for soil, 14-19% for pan surface) and increased soil water content (saving 33-51%). Additionally, these systems reduced average solar radiation exposure. The study suggests that AVSD can address water scarcity, food supply, and energy production challenges concurrently.

This article demonstrated that using photovoltaic panels (PVPs) to shade irrigated vegetable crops can save 14-29% of evapotranspired water, varying with the shade level and crop type. The study used a theoretical framework to identify and rank biophysical processes responsible for water savings under PVPs. Key findings include:

- **AET (actual evapotranspiration) Reduction:** Achieved by decreasing climatic demand due to reduced incident radiation in shaded areas.
- **Crop-Specific Responses:** For lettuces, water savings were influenced by increased soil coverage by plants and higher stomatal conductance in response to shading.
- **Sensitivity to Shading:** Soil evaporation was more sensitive to shading than plant transpiration.
- **Water Use Efficiency (WUE):** Improved only for some lettuce varieties in higher shade levels. Enhanced WUE could be achieved by selecting crops that rapidly cover the ground, optimizing the transpiration/evaporation (T/E) ratio for given water loss. This strategy is more effective in shaded areas, as it reduces soil evaporation and allows plants with high cover rates to intercept light and photosynthesize more efficiently.
- **Stability of WUE:** The study notes that WUE remains relatively stable, especially when irrigation allows evapotranspiration and biomass production to reach their potential. However, PVPs might be more beneficial for crops under water stress.

The conclusion suggests that while PVPs can improve water efficiency, their impact varies with crop type and irrigation levels, and more research is needed to explore these dynamics further, especially in water-stressed conditions.

Padovan, M. D. P., Brook, R. M., Barrios, M., Cruz-Castillo, J. B., Vilchez-Mendoza, S. J., Costa, A. N., & Rapidel, B. (2018). Water loss by transpiration and soil evaporation in coffee shaded by Tabebuia rosea Bertol. and Simarouba glauca dc. compared to unshaded coffee in sub-optimal environmental conditions. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 248, 1-14. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.08.036.

In Nicaragua, a study comparing the water use efficiency of coffee plants grown in agroforestry systems (AFS) with those in full sun systems (FS) under less-than-ideal conditions for coffee cultivation revealed significant differences favoring AFS. The findings showed that AFS was markedly more efficient in water use, with a higher percentage of evapotranspiration attributed to plant transpiration (83% in AFS versus 69% in FS) and lower water loss through soil evaporation (17% in AFS versus 31% in FS), indicating that AFS makes better use of rainfall by channeling it more towards plant use rather than losing it to evaporation.

The study detailed how, within AFS, coffee plants accounted for the majority of water transpiration (72.5%), while the shade trees, deciduous Tabebuia rosea and evergreen Simarouba glauca, contributed to the remainder. Notably, Tabebuia rosea exhibited significantly higher transpiration rates compared to Simarouba glauca, underscoring the impact of shade tree species on water dynamics within the system.

Soil water content measurements up to a depth of 2.0 meters revealed that AFS systems utilized available water reserves more extensively than FS, with lower soil water reserves in AFS indicating a higher overall water use. Coffee plants in AFS also had a higher Leaf Area Index (LAI), making them more efficient on a per leaf area basis, although the higher LAI led to greater overall transpiration in AFS.

Competition for water between coffee plants and shade trees was observed only during severe dry periods, suggesting that, under normal conditions, the system provided adequate water for both. However, prolonged dry spells could induce competition for water resources. The study identified the evergreen Simarouba glauca as a more suitable shade tree compared to Tabebuia rosea due to its consistent and lower water usage, deeper rooting pattern, and lesser competition with coffee plants for water.

Furthermore, shade from trees in AFS significantly reduced soil surface evaporation, a factor further enhanced by the presence of a litter layer, contributing to the system's higher water use efficiency.

In AIP conference proceedings (Vol. 2635, No. 1). AIP Publishing. https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0103124.

This research, centered around a German research station from November 2019 to early April 2020, investigates the effects of solar panel shading on evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture, and plant growth. The study reveals nuanced interactions between solar panels and environmental parameters that influence agricultural outcomes.

Evapotranspiration beneath the solar panels was found to closely match that of an unshaded reference site, with a slight difference in total ET measurements (163 mm under panels versus 158 mm at the reference site). Notably, the percolation rate at the reference site was significantly higher, with 89.5 mm compared to no detectable seepage under the panels, highlighting the panels' impact on water infiltration.

The study identified a seasonal dependency in ET rates, observing lower ET beneath the panels during the growing season due to diminished solar radiation and cooler soil temperatures. Conversely, in the non-growing season, ET rates increased beneath the panels because the panels trapped outgoing radiation, thereby raising soil temperatures and, subsequently, ET rates.

Supporting observations from a conventional photovoltaic park indicated that soil moisture levels were higher under the panels from late spring to late summer, and soil temperatures were warmer under the panels during winter. These conditions contribute to the elevated winter ET rates observed beneath the panels.

Plant growth dynamics were also affected, with rape plants beneath the panels reaching an average of 20 cm taller than those in unshaded areas by the end of the shading period. However, despite the increased growth in height, yield beneath the panels was lower, suggesting that the reduced light availability during early growth stages may have adversely affected plant development and yield potential.

Global radiation measurements corroborated the significant shading effect of the panels, leading to cooler soil temperatures and reduced transpiration rates during the growing season, thereby resulting in lower ET beneath the panels.

This investigation focuses on the impact of Salix (willow) vegetation on soil water dynamics within the semiarid Ordos Basin in China, contrasting vegetated sites with barren lands to understand the role of vegetation in altering soil and groundwater characteristics. The study uncovers that evapotranspiration (ET) rates at the vegetated site significantly outpaced evaporation (E) at the non-vegetated site, pinpointing transpiration by vegetation as a key factor in soil water depletion. Interestingly, the barren site saw an increase in soil water storage, attributing to effective rainwater retention both in the shallow vadose zone and deeper layers, whereas the vegetated site experienced a marked reduction in soil water storage, with all rainwater being absorbed by plant roots and no seepage noted, thereby accentuating the profound influence of root water uptake on soil moisture dynamics.

An innovative aspect of the research was the development of an exponential normal composite model for root water uptake, which demonstrated how vegetation alters soil water flow, essentially segregating soil water layers and hindering the natural recharge of deeper soil and groundwater by precipitation. This finding suggests a paradox where vegetation enhances soil infiltration but simultaneously increases water consumption, limiting deeper soil water recharge.

The implications of these findings for groundwater management and vegetation restoration in semiarid areas are significant. They underscore the necessity of incorporating the hydrodynamic roles of vegetation into the planning and implementation of restoration projects to ensure they do not inadvertently compromise groundwater reserves by overly diminishing soil water levels. The study vividly illustrates the distinct hydrological outcomes between vegetated and barren sites, with the presence of vegetation drastically changing soil water storage dynamics, evaporation, and transpiration rates, thereby deeply influencing the hydrological cycle in semiarid landscapes.

This research focused on evaluating the accuracy of transpiration rate estimations for honey mesquite trees in a semiarid setting by comparing outcomes from heat balance stem flow gauges and porometer-based leaf stomatal conductance measurements. The latter were scaled to whole-stem transpiration values, factoring in the leaf area of the stem. The study revealed several crucial insights:

Both measurement techniques displayed consistent diurnal transpiration patterns, although discrepancies emerged on specific days, particularly in June. By October, transpiration estimates derived from porometer readings consistently surpassed those obtained via stem flow gauges, a difference attributed to the porometer's exclusion of damaged leaves, which likely transpire less.

Experiments involving artificial shading and defoliation demonstrated that both methods captured comparable reductions in transpiration rates, underscoring the impact of leaf removal or shading on the tree's water loss.

A regression analysis between the two methods showed a strong correlation, with coefficients indicating a good match, especially in October. Nonetheless, discrepancies, particularly at peak transpiration levels, pointed to potential limitations in accuracy when transpiration rates are high.

The study also delved into the effect of within-stem shading, noting that leaves shaded by others in the tree's canopy transpired at different rates. This led to the adoption of a stratified sampling approach to better account for these variations.

Further experimentation confirmed that shading significantly reduces both leaf and overall stem transpiration rates, suggesting that shading plays a crucial role in the plant's water use efficiency.

The challenge of accurately scaling porometer readings to whole-stem transpiration was highlighted, especially due to factors like within-stem shading and leaf damage, which introduce variability.
