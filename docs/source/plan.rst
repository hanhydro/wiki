This article addresses concerns about biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, emphasizing the need for detailed study and tailored political strategies, like the EU's Biodiversity 2020 Strategy. It highlights the role of green infrastructures in restoring ecosystems and protecting natural capital, defining them as networks of natural and semi-natural areas that deliver ecosystem services. The concept stresses the importance of quality, quantity, and interconnectivity of green spaces in urban and rural settings.

The research discussed demonstrates how solar plants, if appropriately located and managed, can serve as green infrastructures. They provide wildlife habitats, support species conservation, and contribute to ecological networks, offering environmental, economic, educational, and recreational benefits. The planning and design of solar farms require a multidisciplinary approach, integrating engineering with sustainable and environmental sciences.

The life span of solar farms, about 20-30 years, raises considerations for post-decommissioning land use. Options include replacing old panels with more efficient ones to increase power capacity without expanding land use or, alternatively, converting decommissioned solar farms into "new urban photo-ecological gardens." These gardens can continue to serve as biodiversity reserves and maintain ecological functions.

The integration of such projects into strategic environmental assessments (SEA) and environmental impact assessments (EIA) is proposed. These assessments are crucial for evaluating environmental impacts and promoting sustainable development. The introduction of "new urban photo-ecological gardens" in renewable energy projects can serve as a mitigation measure to enhance ecological and socio-economic value in landscapes. At the regional level, these measures can be incorporated into energy plans to achieve strategic environmental objectives.

Oudes, D., Van Den Brink, A., & Stremke, S. (2022). Towards a typology of solar energy landscapes: Mixed-production, nature based and landscape inclusive solar power transitions. Energy Research & Social Science, 91, 102742. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2022.102742

This study developed and examined a typology for multifunctional solar power plants (SPPs) to aid transparent, evidence-based decision-making. The typology, confirmed through expert interviews and case studies, encompasses four dimensions: energy, economic, nature, and landscape. These dimensions demonstrate how multifunctional SPPs, differing from traditional monofunctional ones, emerge from the interplay of social and material relations. The study identifies three main types of SPPs: mixed-production, nature-inclusive, and landscape-inclusive, through analysis of 20 diverse SPPs.

The study notes that not all multifunctional SPP types have gained equal attention in academic, industrial, or design circles. Nature-inclusive SPPs, backed by multiple case studies, have already attracted significant scholarly interest. Conversely, landscape-inclusive SPPs, despite evident case examples, have received limited scientific exploration. SPPs combining economic and nature functions represent an untapped opportunity for innovation in both academic research and practical application.

This typology contributes to local decision-making on solar energy landscapes and responds to Pasqualetti and Stremke's call for advancing discussions on energy landscapes. Their initial typology, focusing on energy sources (substantive qualification), spatial and temporal aspects, is extended in this study. It emphasizes the spatial configuration of solar power plants, considering energy density, spatial dominance, and compatibility with other land uses. The research shows that adjusting photovoltaic (PV) infrastructure, such as energy density and panel height, allows energy generation to coexist with other functions, spanning from sharply bordered, monofunctional to diffusely bordered, multifunctional landscapes.
