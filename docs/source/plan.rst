This article addresses concerns about biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, emphasizing the need for detailed study and tailored political strategies, like the EU's Biodiversity 2020 Strategy. It highlights the role of green infrastructures in restoring ecosystems and protecting natural capital, defining them as networks of natural and semi-natural areas that deliver ecosystem services. The concept stresses the importance of quality, quantity, and interconnectivity of green spaces in urban and rural settings.

The research discussed demonstrates how solar plants, if appropriately located and managed, can serve as green infrastructures. They provide wildlife habitats, support species conservation, and contribute to ecological networks, offering environmental, economic, educational, and recreational benefits. The planning and design of solar farms require a multidisciplinary approach, integrating engineering with sustainable and environmental sciences.

The life span of solar farms, about 20-30 years, raises considerations for post-decommissioning land use. Options include replacing old panels with more efficient ones to increase power capacity without expanding land use or, alternatively, converting decommissioned solar farms into "new urban photo-ecological gardens." These gardens can continue to serve as biodiversity reserves and maintain ecological functions.

The integration of such projects into strategic environmental assessments (SEA) and environmental impact assessments (EIA) is proposed. These assessments are crucial for evaluating environmental impacts and promoting sustainable development. The introduction of "new urban photo-ecological gardens" in renewable energy projects can serve as a mitigation measure to enhance ecological and socio-economic value in landscapes. At the regional level, these measures can be incorporated into energy plans to achieve strategic environmental objectives.
