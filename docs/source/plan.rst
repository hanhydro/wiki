This article addresses concerns about biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, emphasizing the need for detailed study and tailored political strategies, like the EU's Biodiversity 2020 Strategy. It highlights the role of green infrastructures in restoring ecosystems and protecting natural capital, defining them as networks of natural and semi-natural areas that deliver ecosystem services. The concept stresses the importance of quality, quantity, and interconnectivity of green spaces in urban and rural settings.

The research discussed demonstrates how solar plants, if appropriately located and managed, can serve as green infrastructures. They provide wildlife habitats, support species conservation, and contribute to ecological networks, offering environmental, economic, educational, and recreational benefits. The planning and design of solar farms require a multidisciplinary approach, integrating engineering with sustainable and environmental sciences.

The life span of solar farms, about 20-30 years, raises considerations for post-decommissioning land use. Options include replacing old panels with more efficient ones to increase power capacity without expanding land use or, alternatively, converting decommissioned solar farms into "new urban photo-ecological gardens." These gardens can continue to serve as biodiversity reserves and maintain ecological functions.

The integration of such projects into strategic environmental assessments (SEA) and environmental impact assessments (EIA) is proposed. These assessments are crucial for evaluating environmental impacts and promoting sustainable development. The introduction of "new urban photo-ecological gardens" in renewable energy projects can serve as a mitigation measure to enhance ecological and socio-economic value in landscapes. At the regional level, these measures can be incorporated into energy plans to achieve strategic environmental objectives.

This study developed and examined a typology for multifunctional solar power plants (SPPs) to aid transparent, evidence-based decision-making. The typology, confirmed through expert interviews and case studies, encompasses four dimensions: energy, economic, nature, and landscape. These dimensions demonstrate how multifunctional SPPs, differing from traditional monofunctional ones, emerge from the interplay of social and material relations. The study identifies three main types of SPPs: mixed-production, nature-inclusive, and landscape-inclusive, through analysis of 20 diverse SPPs.

The study notes that not all multifunctional SPP types have gained equal attention in academic, industrial, or design circles. Nature-inclusive SPPs, backed by multiple case studies, have already attracted significant scholarly interest. Conversely, landscape-inclusive SPPs, despite evident case examples, have received limited scientific exploration. SPPs combining economic and nature functions represent an untapped opportunity for innovation in both academic research and practical application.

This typology contributes to local decision-making on solar energy landscapes and responds to Pasqualetti and Stremke's call for advancing discussions on energy landscapes. Their initial typology, focusing on energy sources (substantive qualification), spatial and temporal aspects, is extended in this study. It emphasizes the spatial configuration of solar power plants, considering energy density, spatial dominance, and compatibility with other land uses. The research shows that adjusting photovoltaic (PV) infrastructure, such as energy density and panel height, allows energy generation to coexist with other functions, spanning from sharply bordered, monofunctional to diffusely bordered, multifunctional landscapes.


Boundary effect

This research delved into how edge effects influence water relations and gas exchange in Eucalyptus arenacea trees at the boundary between an open forest and different land uses, including cleared agricultural land (pasture edges) and eucalypt plantations with a designated fire break (plantation edges). The investigation unveiled distinct responses in groundwater usage and evapotranspiration patterns based on the proximity to varying land uses, presenting nuanced insights into the environmental dynamics at play.

Trees located at pasture edges demonstrated enhanced photosynthesis, transpiration, and stomatal conductance relative to those within the forest interior, a phenomenon attributed to increased light exposure and elevated branch water potentials. This scenario suggests a spike in water utilization at pasture edges, potentially amplifying evapotranspiration rates in these segments.

Conversely, the bordering areas next to plantations experienced a downturn in gas exchange rates during winter, a result of shading effects that moderated the microclimate at these edges. However, during summer, although the differences were less marked, there was an indication of improved water use efficiency at the plantation edges, hinting at a possible water competition scenario between the plantation and woodland edge trees, especially under dry conditions.

Employing a Jarvis-type model for assessing stand transpiration revealed that the summer months saw an uptick in transpiration rates at pasture edges compared to those adjoining plantations, with annual transpiration rates significantly higher at pasture edges. This pattern underscores the considerable influence that adjacent land use exerts on water consumption at the stand level within these forest systems.

The study's outcomes emphasize the implications of such edge effects on local groundwater reserves, with woodland borders next to pastures potentially facing heightened water use and subsequent impacts on groundwater due to escalated evapotranspiration. This observation stresses the necessity for incorporating edge effects into landscape-level water flux models, ensuring these models reflect the nuanced impacts of adjacent land uses on forest stand transpiration, particularly in landscapes marked by high fragmentation.

Additionally, the research points to the potential for mild water stress in woodland edge trees adjacent to eucalypt plantations during drier periods, driven by direct competition for water resources. This underscores the complex interplay between forest edges and neighboring land uses, significantly impacting water dynamics.
