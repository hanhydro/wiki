This research delved into the effects of employing a 30% black shading screen within a screenhouse on the microclimate, crop water requirements, and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) for cultivating sweet peppers, in comparison to traditional outdoor farming conditions. The investigation brought to light substantial benefits for water conservation, crop management, and environmental regulation within protected agricultural practices. 

A key outcome from the study was the significant reduction in global radiation due to the shading screen, which decreased mean global radiation (R_G) by over 40%, with a notable 56% reduction of daily global radiation inside the screenhouse relative to open field conditions. This reduction in radiation was accompanied by a substantial decrease in wind speed by more than 50%, showcasing the screen's capability to modify microclimatic conditions effectively.

One of the most impactful findings was the 38% reduction in crop water requirements (ET_c) inside the screenhouse compared to an open field, indicating potential for significant water savings in crop production. Despite these changes, the screenhouse did not significantly alter the maximum temperature (T_max) and daily vapor pressure deficit (VPD), thus avoiding the overheating or humidity problems commonly associated with greenhouse environments.

The study also highlighted the accuracy of the FAO-Penman–Monteith model, adapted for screenhouse conditions, in predicting daily crop evapotranspiration (ET_c), which aligned closely with lysimeter measurements. This points to the potential for precise water management in screened environments. Furthermore, the reported high IWUE values in 2004 and 2005 underscore the efficient water use achievable under shaded conditions, although the impact of shading on crop yield and the water-saving capabilities of different screen types warrants further exploration.

Economically, the study found that the water savings and potential yield increases under screenhouse conditions do not, at current pricing for water and produce, justify the investment costs. This suggests that the economic viability of screenhouses depends on achieving substantial yield improvements to offset the initial outlay for screenhouse installation.

Ferrara, G., Boselli, M., Palasciano, M., & Mazzeo, A. (2023). Effect of shading determined by photovoltaic panels installed above the vines on the performance of cv. Corvina (Vitis vinifera L.). Scientia Horticulturae, 308, 111595. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2022.111595.

The investigation into the impact of photovoltaic (PV) panels on Corvina grapevines in Northern Italy from 2017 to 2019 reveals nuanced effects of agrivoltaic (AV) systems on vine physiology, microclimate moderation, yield, and grape quality. The study found that PV panels provided a cooling effect, lowering air and soil temperatures, which in turn influenced vine transpiration and photosynthesis rates. These adaptations suggest that the vines adjusted to the modified light conditions provided by the shading, resulting in less negative stem water potentials and indicating a reduction in water stress for the vines under AV systems.

The research observed that while vine productivity parameters such as yield, cluster number, and weight were slightly affected by shading, with a noted decrease in anthocyanins, total soluble solids (TSS), and polyphenols, there were also potential benefits in extreme weather conditions. Specifically, the AV systems could offer advantages during hot and dry periods, enhancing both energy production and fruit cultivation by mitigating water stress and potentially improving yield under such climatic challenges.

AV systems emerge as beneficial for electrical self-sufficiency and reducing fossil fuel dependency by coupling crop production with renewable energy generation. The potential for shading to aid crops in hot, arid environments by lowering temperatures and alleviating water stress underscores the systems' capability to possibly boost yields in challenging conditions.

Despite observed reductions in certain yield parameters under PV panel shading, the broader advantages of integrated energy production and the potential for improved crop conditions in hot and dry climates underscore the viability of AV systems. This balance between renewable energy generation and agricultural productivity is particularly pertinent for areas facing water limitations or the impacts of climate change.

The study advocates for further exploration of AV systems across different environmental settings, emphasizing their promise for sustainable agriculture and energy production, especially on marginal or unused lands. AV systems might be especially advantageous for woody crops and fruit trees, including grapevines, in regions experiencing water scarcity and high sunlight exposure.
