This research delved into the effects of employing a 30% black shading screen within a screenhouse on the microclimate, crop water requirements, and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) for cultivating sweet peppers, in comparison to traditional outdoor farming conditions. The investigation brought to light substantial benefits for water conservation, crop management, and environmental regulation within protected agricultural practices. 

A key outcome from the study was the significant reduction in global radiation due to the shading screen, which decreased mean global radiation (R_G) by over 40%, with a notable 56% reduction of daily global radiation inside the screenhouse relative to open field conditions. This reduction in radiation was accompanied by a substantial decrease in wind speed by more than 50%, showcasing the screen's capability to modify microclimatic conditions effectively.

One of the most impactful findings was the 38% reduction in crop water requirements (ET_c) inside the screenhouse compared to an open field, indicating potential for significant water savings in crop production. Despite these changes, the screenhouse did not significantly alter the maximum temperature (T_max) and daily vapor pressure deficit (VPD), thus avoiding the overheating or humidity problems commonly associated with greenhouse environments.

The study also highlighted the accuracy of the FAO-Penman–Monteith model, adapted for screenhouse conditions, in predicting daily crop evapotranspiration (ET_c), which aligned closely with lysimeter measurements. This points to the potential for precise water management in screened environments. Furthermore, the reported high IWUE values in 2004 and 2005 underscore the efficient water use achievable under shaded conditions, although the impact of shading on crop yield and the water-saving capabilities of different screen types warrants further exploration.

Economically, the study found that the water savings and potential yield increases under screenhouse conditions do not, at current pricing for water and produce, justify the investment costs. This suggests that the economic viability of screenhouses depends on achieving substantial yield improvements to offset the initial outlay for screenhouse installation.
