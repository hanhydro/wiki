Guber, A. K., Pachepsky, Y. A., Van Genuchten, M. T., Rawls, W. J., Simunek, J., Jacques, D., ... & Cady, R. E. (2006). Field-scale water flow simulations using ensembles of pedotransfer functions for soil water retention. Vadose Zone Journal, 5(1), 234-247. https://doi.org/10.2136/vzj2005.0111.
The research focuses on the use of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to estimate soil hydraulic properties for simulating soil water flow, particularly for large-scale projects or pilot studies. The study emphasizes the challenges of applying PTFs outside their development dataset, highlighting the variability in model performance across different regions. To address these challenges, an ensemble approach of 22 published PTFs was utilized, leveraging their collective predictive power to improve the accuracy of soil water regime simulations. The study was conducted on a layered loamy soil in Belgium, incorporating soil water content, pressure head measurements, and water flux data from a specifically designed experimental setup.

Key findings include:
- The ensemble of PTFs produced significantly more accurate soil water content simulations compared to using laboratory-measured water retention data alone, with average errors being two times smaller for the ensemble approach.
- The research demonstrated that the ensemble method provided a better approximation of field water retention, suggesting its potential as a reliable source for estimating soil hydraulic properties.
- Despite the inherent uncertainties in using PTFs developed from different datasets and regions, the ensemble approach mitigated these issues, offering a promising methodology for improving the simulation of soil water dynamics.
- The study also underlined the importance of considering the variability and uncertainty associated with both laboratory-measured and PTF-estimated data in soil hydraulic property simulations.

Important values highlighted in the summary include:
- The use of an ensemble of 22 published PTFs significantly reduced the average simulation errors when compared to using laboratory-measured data, highlighting the effectiveness of the ensemble approach in soil water content simulations.
- The ensemble approach's ability to closely approximate field water retention compared to laboratory data, indicating its potential reliability for estimating soil hydraulic properties.
- The acknowledgment of variability and uncertainty in PTF-based estimations and the strategies employed to address these challenges in the context of soil water flow simulations.
