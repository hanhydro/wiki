H.R.1840 â€” 118th Congress (2023-2024)
-----------------

- TITLE I: 

Title I of the legislation outlines national goals focused on combating climate change through significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within the agricultural sector. The primary aim is to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by setting ambitious targets for emission reductions: a 50-percent reduction by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2040, compared to 2010 levels. To support these goals, the legislation sets forth several subgoals across different areas:

1. Research: It advocates for a substantial increase in federal investment in agriculture and food research, focusing on climate change mitigation and adaptation, soil health, nutrient management, and sustainable farming practices, aiming to triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040 compared to 2023 levels.
2. Soil Health: It emphasizes soil carbon sequestration and reducing nitrous oxide emissions through practices like crop rotation, cover cropping, and conservation tillage, with specific targets set for 2030 and 2040.
3. Farmland Preservation: The legislation aims to drastically reduce the conversion of agricultural land to development and grassland to cropping by 80 percent by 2030, with a goal of halting it entirely by 2040.
4. Pasture-Based Livestock: It sets targets for advanced grazing management and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, focusing on integrating crop and livestock production systems and improving manure management practices.
5. On-Farm Renewable Energy: It encourages energy audits, efficiency improvements, and the expansion of clean renewable energy production on farms, with goals set for 2030 and 2040.
6. Food Loss and Waste: The legislation commits to significantly reducing food loss and waste, aiming for a 50-percent reduction by 2030 and a 75-percent reduction by 2040, while promoting composting and other waste diversion methods.

To implement these goals, the Secretary is tasked with developing a comprehensive action plan, open to public comment, that includes regulatory actions, incentives, research, and development programs. This plan aims to benefit farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and the environment while prioritizing investments that reduce emissions and sequester carbon. The Secretary must finalize the plan within 18 months of the Act's enactment, begin implementation, submit it to Congress, and provide annual updates and reports on progress.

- TITLE II: 

Title II of the legislation focuses on research, extension, and education initiatives aimed at addressing climate change within the agricultural sector. It amends existing laws and establishes new programs to accelerate the transition of U.S. agriculture towards net-zero carbon emissions and beyond, to being carbon-negative. Key components include:

1. Research, Extension, and Education Purpose Amendment: It broadens the scope of agricultural research to include efforts to achieve net-zero carbon emissions and develop food systems resilient to climate change and other disruptions.

2. Regional Hubs for Risk Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change: This establishes a network of regional hubs to provide farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners with region-specific, science-based information and support for adapting to and mitigating climate change.

3. Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Resilience Initiative: It emphasizes increasing resilience to climate change and related shocks, integrating crop and livestock management systems, and promoting practices that support year-round living cover on farms.

4. Long-term Agroecosystem Research Network: This initiative aims to maintain a network of research sites for studying the sustainability of agricultural systems, with a focus on understanding and enhancing their resilience and productivity in the face of climate change.

5. Public Breed and Cultivar Research: It prioritizes the development of regionally adapted, environmentally resilient public animal breeds and cultivars, emphasizing their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation.

6. ARS Climate Scientist Career Development Program: This program supports graduate student internships in the Agricultural Research Service, focusing on climate change and agriculture.

7. Agricultural Climate Adaptation and Mitigation through AFRI: It expands research on agricultural climate adaptation and mitigation, including strategies for small and medium-sized farms, on-farm mitigation strategies, and the economic and social impacts of conservation practices.

8. Specialty Crop Research Initiative: This amendment includes efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change within the scope of specialty crop research, focusing on on-farm mitigation strategies and breeding research for climate adaptability.

9. Integrated Pest Management: The program is updated to emphasize climate resilience and prioritize ecologically based pest management approaches that are effective, affordable, environmentally sound, and improve climate resilience.

10. Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas Program: It updates the program to emphasize increasing on-farm resilience to extreme weather, improving soil health, enhancing farm viability, and strengthening supply chains.

Overall, Title II aims to modernize and enhance agricultural research, education, and extension efforts to better equip the sector to face the challenges of climate change, emphasizing sustainability, resilience, and carbon mitigation.

- TITLE III:

Title III addresses soil health within the context of agricultural practices and policies, aiming to enhance environmental quality and combat climate change through various amendments and initiatives. Key points are:

### Crop Insurance Adjustments
- Voluntary Good Farming Practices: Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to include conservation practices approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service or an agricultural expert as good farming practices.
- Risk-Reduction Based Discounts: Introduces premium discounts for producers using practices that reduce risk, such as cover crops, crop rotation, and agroforestry, starting from the 2024 reinsurance year.

### Enhancements to the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)
- Broadens the purposes of EQIP to include climate change adaptation and mitigation, emphasizing greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon sequestration.
- Updates definitions to include considerations for greenhouse gas emissions reduction planning and soil health.
- Adjusts payment structures to prioritize carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions reduction practices.

### Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) Revisions
- Modifies CSP to encourage maintaining, managing, and improving existing conservation activities while adopting additional ones.
- Includes specific provisions for organic production and systems that promote soil health and carbon sequestration.

### State Assistance for Soil Health
- Establishes grants for states or tribal governments to develop and implement soil health improvement plans, with a focus on technical assistance, financial support, and research.

### Funding and Administration
- Increases funding for various conservation programs and introduces a special initiative for technical assistance to help producers mitigate and adapt to climate change.

### Conservation Compliance Reforms
- Expands conservation compliance requirements to encompass broader cropland conservation efforts, focusing on soil health improvement and erosion control.

### National and Regional Agroforestry Centers
- Establishes a National Agroforestry Center and mandates the creation of regional agroforestry centers to research and promote agroforestry practices that improve soil health, carbon sequestration, and resilience.

### Miscellaneous Provisions
- Includes various technical adjustments and funding allocations to support the initiatives outlined in Title III, aiming to enhance soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.
