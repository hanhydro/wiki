H.R.1840 â€” 118th Congress (2023-2024)
-----------------

- TITLE I: 

Title I of the legislation outlines national goals focused on combating climate change through significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within the agricultural sector. The primary aim is to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by setting ambitious targets for emission reductions: a 50-percent reduction by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2040, compared to 2010 levels. To support these goals, the legislation sets forth several subgoals across different areas:

1. **Research**: It advocates for a substantial increase in federal investment in agriculture and food research, focusing on climate change mitigation and adaptation, soil health, nutrient management, and sustainable farming practices, aiming to triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040 compared to 2023 levels.
2. **Soil Health**: It emphasizes soil carbon sequestration and reducing nitrous oxide emissions through practices like crop rotation, cover cropping, and conservation tillage, with specific targets set for 2030 and 2040.
3. **Farmland Preservation**: The legislation aims to drastically reduce the conversion of agricultural land to development and grassland to cropping by 80 percent by 2030, with a goal of halting it entirely by 2040.
4. **Pasture-Based Livestock**: It sets targets for advanced grazing management and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, focusing on integrating crop and livestock production systems and improving manure management practices.
5. **On-Farm Renewable Energy**: It encourages energy audits, efficiency improvements, and the expansion of clean renewable energy production on farms, with goals set for 2030 and 2040.
6. **Food Loss and Waste**: The legislation commits to significantly reducing food loss and waste, aiming for a 50-percent reduction by 2030 and a 75-percent reduction by 2040, while promoting composting and other waste diversion methods.

To implement these goals, the Secretary is tasked with developing a comprehensive action plan, open to public comment, that includes regulatory actions, incentives, research, and development programs. This plan aims to benefit farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and the environment while prioritizing investments that reduce emissions and sequester carbon. The Secretary must finalize the plan within 18 months of the Act's enactment, begin implementation, submit it to Congress, and provide annual updates and reports on progress.
