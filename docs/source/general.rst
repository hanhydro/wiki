The integration of conservation agriculture management practices (CAMP) with agrivoltaics (AV) presents a promising solution to global challenges like climate change, food security, and sustainable land management. AV, which combines solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and food production on the same land, offers a unique way to simultaneously enhance energy and food security while minimizing land use conflicts. The success of AV as a climate change mitigation strategy depends largely on the adoption of CAMP strategies. These practices, which include methods like zero tillage, cover crops, crop rotation, and intercropping, can increase carbon storage, improve soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance biodiversity. They also hold potential for better economic returns at both individual and societal levels.

However, there are challenges to implementing CAMP in AV, notably economic considerations that may affect its attractiveness to individual farms despite its societal benefits. These societal benefits, such as reduced emissions and improved environmental quality, could be key to developing incentive programs and policy support. Research and data on the effectiveness of CAMP in AV systems are still developing, and more investigation is needed. The integration of these practices not only promises a more resilient and sustainable future but also emphasizes the role of policymakers, farmers, researchers, and other stakeholders in maximizing the potential of AV with CAMP.
