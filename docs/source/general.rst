The integration of conservation agriculture management practices (CAMP) with agrivoltaics (AV) presents a promising solution to global challenges like climate change, food security, and sustainable land management. AV, which combines solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and food production on the same land, offers a unique way to simultaneously enhance energy and food security while minimizing land use conflicts. The success of AV as a climate change mitigation strategy depends largely on the adoption of CAMP strategies. These practices, which include methods like zero tillage, cover crops, crop rotation, and intercropping, can increase carbon storage, improve soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance biodiversity. They also hold potential for better economic returns at both individual and societal levels.

However, there are challenges to implementing CAMP in AV, notably economic considerations that may affect its attractiveness to individual farms despite its societal benefits. These societal benefits, such as reduced emissions and improved environmental quality, could be key to developing incentive programs and policy support. Research and data on the effectiveness of CAMP in AV systems are still developing, and more investigation is needed. The integration of these practices not only promises a more resilient and sustainable future but also emphasizes the role of policymakers, farmers, researchers, and other stakeholders in maximizing the potential of AV with CAMP.

This study provides an evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with large-scale solar power plants in comparison to conventional power generation techniques, focusing on a wide array of factors including land use intensity, effects on human health, biodiversity, geohydrological resources, and climate change mitigation efforts. It concludes that solar power is environmentally beneficial across a broad spectrum, with a significant majority of the assessed impacts—22 out of 32—being favorable and none found to be negative when set against traditional energy sources.

The analysis highlights that solar power plants, over time, tend to require similar or even less land per unit of electricity generated compared to the lifecycle of coal power plants. It is noted that solar becomes more land-use efficient than coal after about 24-27 years of operation, based on metrics evaluating land transformation and occupation. In terms of CO2 emissions, the study acknowledges emissions resulting from the clearance of forests for solar installations but points out that these are considerably lower than those from coal-fired power, emphasizing solar power's role as a low-carbon alternative despite the initial environmental cost of land clearing.

Regarding biodiversity and soil impact, the study observes that the effect of solar power varies with the biome, with forested areas raising the most significant concerns due to their high biodiversity. However, the overall impact on wildlife and habitats is minimal, especially in less biodiverse environments like deserts. Interestingly, the study suggests solar power installations could offer indirect benefits to local wildlife through mitigation efforts funded by solar projects.

The potential impacts of solar power on geohydrological resources, including changes in soil infiltration rates, runoff ratios, and evapotranspiration, are recognized. However, these are deemed manageable with the implementation of appropriate mitigation strategies, which could mitigate risks to groundwater recharge and flooding. On the subject of climate change, solar power is heralded for its substantial contribution to greenhouse gas emission reductions, offering a stark contrast to the high emissions associated with traditional fossil fuel-based power generation.

This review on agrivoltaic systems presented synthesizes research findings on integrating crop production and photovoltaic (PV) power generation, aiming to address land use efficiency amidst growing demands for food and renewable energy. The review encompasses 98 studies, with a focus on engineering, financial models, and large-scale applications involving livestock grazing. It highlights the predominant research from the northern hemisphere, underscoring the need for comprehensive financial performance models and further exploration into large-scale agrivoltaic facilities that incorporate livestock.

From the study, major points are indicated. A substantial increase in publications over the last five years, indicating growing interest and research activity in agrivoltaics. The majority of studies are peer-reviewed articles, with Applied Energy being a notable publication source. Research predominantly focuses on medium-to-large-scale PV systems, with a significant portion examining installations exceeding 1 MW. Geographic distribution of agrivoltaic research aligns with areas of high solar irradiation, yet the suitability also depends on local agricultural conditions. The scale of PV and land use economics is a crucial area of study, with half of the reviewed papers discussing facility sizes and the economic implications of agrivoltaics. Operational considerations and the practical influences of agrivoltaics on crop growth, water usage, and solar orientation are vital areas of research.

Important insights in the study are below. A marked shift towards researching agrivoltaic applications in recent years, reflecting an increasing recognition of its potential to simultaneously address energy and agricultural production challenges. The identification of gaps in knowledge, particularly regarding the financial viability of large-scale agrivoltaic systems and their integration with livestock grazing, pointing to new directions for future research. A call for more detailed economic analyses and models to better understand the financial performance of agrivoltaic systems across different scales and settings.

The article discusses the importance and development of Agricultural Photovoltaic (APV) systems as a solution to the challenges posed by the need for renewable energy expansion and the efficient use of land. With the increasing efficiency and decreasing cost of photovoltaic (PV) technology, solar energy emerges as a vital renewable resource to meet net-zero emissions targets and mitigate climate change. However, the integration of solar farms into agricultural land, known as APV, presents a promising yet complex strategy to harness solar energy without compromising valuable farmland.

Key discussin is as below. The International Energy Agency (IEA) emphasizes the role of renewable energy technologies, particularly solar PV, in achieving the net-zero emissions goal by 2050 and limiting global warming. The efficiency of commercial PV modules has improved significantly, from about 15% in 2010 to approximately 23% today, while production costs have dropped substantially. APV systems face challenges, such as ensuring sufficient crop yield under the panels due to reduced sunlight, which is a crucial consideration for their widespread adoption. Contrary to concerns about insufficient light, there is evidence that excessive sunlight during certain times can harm crops, suggesting that APV could provide beneficial shading. Innovative solutions like Spectrum Splitting and Concentrated APV (SCAPV) and Even-lighting APV (EAPV) are being explored to optimize light management for both crop growth and solar power generation. The global installed capacity of APV reached around 14 GWp in 2021, indicating growing interest and investment in integrating solar energy production with agriculture.

Important points are presented below.
