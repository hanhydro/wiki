The integration of conservation agriculture management practices (CAMP) with agrivoltaics (AV) presents a promising solution to global challenges like climate change, food security, and sustainable land management. AV, which combines solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and food production on the same land, offers a unique way to simultaneously enhance energy and food security while minimizing land use conflicts. The success of AV as a climate change mitigation strategy depends largely on the adoption of CAMP strategies. These practices, which include methods like zero tillage, cover crops, crop rotation, and intercropping, can increase carbon storage, improve soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance biodiversity. They also hold potential for better economic returns at both individual and societal levels.

However, there are challenges to implementing CAMP in AV, notably economic considerations that may affect its attractiveness to individual farms despite its societal benefits. These societal benefits, such as reduced emissions and improved environmental quality, could be key to developing incentive programs and policy support. Research and data on the effectiveness of CAMP in AV systems are still developing, and more investigation is needed. The integration of these practices not only promises a more resilient and sustainable future but also emphasizes the role of policymakers, farmers, researchers, and other stakeholders in maximizing the potential of AV with CAMP.

This study provides an evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with large-scale solar power plants in comparison to conventional power generation techniques, focusing on a wide array of factors including land use intensity, effects on human health, biodiversity, geohydrological resources, and climate change mitigation efforts. It concludes that solar power is environmentally beneficial across a broad spectrum, with a significant majority of the assessed impacts—22 out of 32—being favorable and none found to be negative when set against traditional energy sources.

The analysis highlights that solar power plants, over time, tend to require similar or even less land per unit of electricity generated compared to the lifecycle of coal power plants. It is noted that solar becomes more land-use efficient than coal after about 24-27 years of operation, based on metrics evaluating land transformation and occupation. In terms of CO2 emissions, the study acknowledges emissions resulting from the clearance of forests for solar installations but points out that these are considerably lower than those from coal-fired power, emphasizing solar power's role as a low-carbon alternative despite the initial environmental cost of land clearing.

Regarding biodiversity and soil impact, the study observes that the effect of solar power varies with the biome, with forested areas raising the most significant concerns due to their high biodiversity. However, the overall impact on wildlife and habitats is minimal, especially in less biodiverse environments like deserts. Interestingly, the study suggests solar power installations could offer indirect benefits to local wildlife through mitigation efforts funded by solar projects.

The potential impacts of solar power on geohydrological resources, including changes in soil infiltration rates, runoff ratios, and evapotranspiration, are recognized. However, these are deemed manageable with the implementation of appropriate mitigation strategies, which could mitigate risks to groundwater recharge and flooding. On the subject of climate change, solar power is heralded for its substantial contribution to greenhouse gas emission reductions, offering a stark contrast to the high emissions associated with traditional fossil fuel-based power generation.
