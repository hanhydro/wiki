This study provides an evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with large-scale solar power plants in comparison to conventional power generation techniques, focusing on a wide array of factors including land use intensity, effects on human health, biodiversity, geohydrological resources, and climate change mitigation efforts. It concludes that solar power is environmentally beneficial across a broad spectrum, with a significant majority of the assessed impacts—22 out of 32—being favorable and none found to be negative when set against traditional energy sources.

The analysis highlights that solar power plants, over time, tend to require similar or even less land per unit of electricity generated compared to the lifecycle of coal power plants. It is noted that solar becomes more land-use efficient than coal after about 24-27 years of operation, based on metrics evaluating land transformation and occupation. In terms of CO2 emissions, the study acknowledges emissions resulting from the clearance of forests for solar installations but points out that these are considerably lower than those from coal-fired power, emphasizing solar power's role as a low-carbon alternative despite the initial environmental cost of land clearing.

Regarding biodiversity and soil impact, the study observes that the effect of solar power varies with the biome, with forested areas raising the most significant concerns due to their high biodiversity. However, the overall impact on wildlife and habitats is minimal, especially in less biodiverse environments like deserts. Interestingly, the study suggests solar power installations could offer indirect benefits to local wildlife through mitigation efforts funded by solar projects.

The potential impacts of solar power on geohydrological resources, including changes in soil infiltration rates, runoff ratios, and evapotranspiration, are recognized. However, these are deemed manageable with the implementation of appropriate mitigation strategies, which could mitigate risks to groundwater recharge and flooding. On the subject of climate change, solar power is heralded for its substantial contribution to greenhouse gas emission reductions, offering a stark contrast to the high emissions associated with traditional fossil fuel-based power generation.

This paper examines the concept of agrivoltaics, a symbiotic integration of agriculture and solar photovoltaic (PV) energy production on the same land. With the increasing demand for land due to a growing global population, and the need for renewable energy sources to combat climate change, agrivoltaics presents a solution to utilize land efficiently for dual purposes. The study reviews existing agrivoltaic experiments and introduces a coupled simulation model combining PV production and agricultural productivity to assess the potential of agrivoltaic systems.

The study reveals that agrivoltaics can significantly enhance the economic value of land by over 30% compared to traditional agriculture alone, by integrating shade-tolerant crops with solar PV installations. This dual land use not only maintains crop yield stability by utilizing crops that can adapt to partial shade but also contributes to national PV power production. For instance, converting lettuce cultivation to agrivoltaic systems in the U.S. alone could generate an additional 40 to 70 GW of solar power.

The research further discusses the technical aspects of agrivoltaic systems, including optimal tilt angles for PV panels to maximize solar energy capture while allowing enough light for crop growth. It also explores the benefits of agrivoltaics in reducing water evaporation, thus saving water, and potentially reducing soil erosion. Moreover, agrivoltaic systems could offer a sustainable energy source for irrigation, enhancing food security in areas with limited electricity access.

Economic analyses suggest that agrivoltaic systems can be profitable, especially with the right crop selection and PV system design. The study emphasizes the need for further research on the shade tolerance of different crops and their productivity under agrivoltaic conditions. Additionally, exploring the economic viability, including the initial capital costs and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of agrivoltaic systems, is crucial for future development.

The integration of conservation agriculture management practices (CAMP) with agrivoltaics (AV) presents a promising solution to global challenges like climate change, food security, and sustainable land management. AV, which combines solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and food production on the same land, offers a unique way to simultaneously enhance energy and food security while minimizing land use conflicts. The success of AV as a climate change mitigation strategy depends largely on the adoption of CAMP strategies. These practices, which include methods like zero tillage, cover crops, crop rotation, and intercropping, can increase carbon storage, improve soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance biodiversity. They also hold potential for better economic returns at both individual and societal levels.

However, there are challenges to implementing CAMP in AV, notably economic considerations that may affect its attractiveness to individual farms despite its societal benefits. These societal benefits, such as reduced emissions and improved environmental quality, could be key to developing incentive programs and policy support. Research and data on the effectiveness of CAMP in AV systems are still developing, and more investigation is needed. The integration of these practices not only promises a more resilient and sustainable future but also emphasizes the role of policymakers, farmers, researchers, and other stakeholders in maximizing the potential of AV with CAMP.

Combining food and energy production: Design of an agrivoltaic system applied in arable and vegetable farming in Germany. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 140, 110694. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.110694.

This study explores the technical feasibility, design considerations, and real-world performance of an Agrivoltaic (APV) system installed near Lake Constance in Germany, as part of the APV-RESOLA project by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE. The unique aspect of this German APV design lies in its accommodation for a wide range of agricultural machinery, made possible by a vertical clearance of 5 meters and a width clearance of up to 19 meters. The research facility allowed for the cultivation of crops such as potato, celeriac, clover grass, and winter wheat under the solar panels, with the dual aim of producing food and generating photovoltaic power.

Key Findings are summarized here. The Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) results revealed a significant increase in land productivity, ranging from 56% to 70% in 2017, and nearly 90% in the dry and hot summer of 2018. These findings underscore the potential of APV systems to enhance land use efficiency, particularly under changing climate conditions. Orientation and row distance of the APV system were identified as critical design parameters affecting light distribution on the ground and thus crop yields. Deviating the system orientation from due south by about 30° resulted in a more equal distribution of radiation, optimizing conditions for both agricultural and electrical yields. The APV system demonstrated resilience against unfavorable weather conditions, such as excessive sunlight or hail, and showed potential for improving water availability and use efficiency for the crops grown beneath. Electrical yield from the APV system was found to be about 17% lower compared to a standard ground-mounted PV system, primarily due to the chosen design to facilitate agricultural activities. However, the bifacial modules used in the APV system captured additional light, offsetting some of the potential yield loss.

Implications are summarized here. This study illustrates the promising potential of agrivoltaics as a multifunctional solution to the competing demands for land use, by simultaneously addressing food production and renewable energy generation. The high LER values obtained from the APV-RESOLA project highlight the potential for agrivoltaics to contribute significantly to sustainable land management, especially in regions facing land scarcity and the impacts of climate change. The successful implementation and positive outcomes of the APV system near Lake Constance suggest that agrivoltaics can play a crucial role in the energy transition towards renewable sources without compromising agricultural productivity. Moreover, the study points to the need for more research on crop responses under APV systems, optimal system designs for different climatic and agricultural conditions, and the development of supportive policy frameworks to encourage the adoption of agrivoltaics.

The article discusses the importance and development of Agricultural Photovoltaic (APV) systems as a solution to the challenges posed by the need for renewable energy expansion and the efficient use of land. With the increasing efficiency and decreasing cost of photovoltaic (PV) technology, solar energy emerges as a vital renewable resource to meet net-zero emissions targets and mitigate climate change. However, the integration of solar farms into agricultural land, known as APV, presents a promising yet complex strategy to harness solar energy without compromising valuable farmland.

Key discussin is as below. The International Energy Agency (IEA) emphasizes the role of renewable energy technologies, particularly solar PV, in achieving the net-zero emissions goal by 2050 and limiting global warming. The efficiency of commercial PV modules has improved significantly, from about 15% in 2010 to approximately 23% today, while production costs have dropped substantially. APV systems face challenges, such as ensuring sufficient crop yield under the panels due to reduced sunlight, which is a crucial consideration for their widespread adoption. Contrary to concerns about insufficient light, there is evidence that excessive sunlight during certain times can harm crops, suggesting that APV could provide beneficial shading. Innovative solutions like Spectrum Splitting and Concentrated APV (SCAPV) and Even-lighting APV (EAPV) are being explored to optimize light management for both crop growth and solar power generation. The global installed capacity of APV reached around 14 GWp in 2021, indicating growing interest and investment in integrating solar energy production with agriculture.

This study explores the integration of agrivoltaic systems in rice paddies, assessing their impact on rice crop yields while simultaneously generating renewable energy. Following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent increase in energy importation, Japan has sought alternative energy sources, including renewable energy, to enhance energy security and reduce carbon emissions. Agrivoltaic systems, which combine photovoltaic panels with agriculture, are seen as a viable solution to utilize land efficiently for both food and energy production.

The research focused on determining the optimal shading rate from photovoltaic panels that would allow rice paddies to maintain at least 80% of their yield, a requirement set by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Findings indicated that a shading rate between 27 to 39% could achieve this balance, suggesting that if agrivoltaic systems were applied at a 28% density across Japan's rice paddies, they could potentially generate 284 million MWh/yr, covering about 29% of Japan's total electricity demand as of 2018.

The study conducted detailed experiments across several farms to evaluate the effects of shading on rice productivity, involving various meteorological measurements and crop sampling techniques to analyze the impacts on rice growth, yield, and quality. It was discovered that shading significantly influenced the number of panicles, a key factor in determining rice yield. Additionally, the study considered the potential electricity generation capabilities of agrivoltaic systems installed in rice paddies across Japan, highlighting their promise in contributing significantly to the country's renewable energy portfolio and helping achieve its carbon neutrality goals by 2050.
