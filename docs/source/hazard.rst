This paper investigates the potential for balancing power generation between wind and solar resources in the Iberian Peninsula. The study finds that wind and solar fields are somewhat complementary, and this complementarity can be leveraged in risk management strategies for energy portfolios, focusing on the optimal mix of generation sites and technologies. The research emphasizes the advantages of considering power mixes over single-site installations, as they minimize supply risk and maximize geographical potential.

The study demonstrates that locations with high production variability can still contribute positively to a power portfolio, especially when other sites are underperforming. The Pareto efficiency analysis suggests a more rational and economical exploitation of wind and solar resources, revealing that selective combinations of generation sites can be as or more effective than large-scale renewable deployments.

Future directions include expanding the analysis to a broader, possibly Europe-wide region to further diversify meteorological or climatological risks. This expansion would require dimensionality-reduction methods to manage asset numbers and avoid redundancy. The study also plans to explore alternative risk and yield measures outside the classical Markowitz framework, although these approaches may pose more complex non-convex optimization challenges.
