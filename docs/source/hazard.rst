This paper investigates the potential for balancing power generation between wind and solar resources in the Iberian Peninsula. The study finds that wind and solar fields are somewhat complementary, and this complementarity can be leveraged in risk management strategies for energy portfolios, focusing on the optimal mix of generation sites and technologies. The research emphasizes the advantages of considering power mixes over single-site installations, as they minimize supply risk and maximize geographical potential.

The study demonstrates that locations with high production variability can still contribute positively to a power portfolio, especially when other sites are underperforming. The Pareto efficiency analysis suggests a more rational and economical exploitation of wind and solar resources, revealing that selective combinations of generation sites can be as or more effective than large-scale renewable deployments.

Future directions include expanding the analysis to a broader, possibly Europe-wide region to further diversify meteorological or climatological risks. This expansion would require dimensionality-reduction methods to manage asset numbers and avoid redundancy. The study also plans to explore alternative risk and yield measures outside the classical Markowitz framework, although these approaches may pose more complex non-convex optimization challenges.

This study delves into the environmental implications of commercial-scale solar energy installations in the Southwestern United States, with a particular focus on their effects on groundwater levels, evapotranspiration rates, ecological systems, and soil integrity. It identifies several operational phase concerns, including the use of dust suppressants, water usage, and groundwater extraction, along with their ecological ramifications.

The use of various chemical dust suppressants to maintain solar panels poses potential risks to aquatic ecosystems by possibly increasing runoff and altering water chemistry, leading to higher salinity, decreased oxygen levels, and algae proliferation. Furthermore, the operational water needs of solar facilities, especially those employing wet cooling systems for steam generation, vary widely and can significantly strain water resources in already arid regions, impacting local aquatic habitats.

Groundwater withdrawal for solar operations emerges as a critical issue, with potential drawdown effects ranging dramatically based on the technology employed—from minimal impact in photovoltaic systems to severe in concentrated solar power systems using wet cooling. Such groundwater depletion could disrupt ecosystems reliant on these water sources, leading to changes in vegetation and facilitating invasive species spread.

Additionally, the study highlights ecological concerns such as the potential for solar facilities to become ecological traps for birds and aquatic insects, attracted by the polarized light from panels, resulting in increased mortality rates. The construction and operational phases of solar energy development could also lead to soil and hydrological disturbances, altering streamflow patterns, and possibly increasing wildfire risks due to vegetation loss, although these could be mitigated with appropriate planning.

Given these varied potential impacts, the study advocates for adopting an adaptive management strategy. This would entail continuous monitoring and hypothesis testing to refine management practices and policies, aiming to reduce the environmental footprint of solar energy development, particularly concerning aquatic habitats and terrestrial ecosystems.
