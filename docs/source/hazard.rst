This paper investigates the potential for balancing power generation between wind and solar resources in the Iberian Peninsula. The study finds that wind and solar fields are somewhat complementary, and this complementarity can be leveraged in risk management strategies for energy portfolios, focusing on the optimal mix of generation sites and technologies. The research emphasizes the advantages of considering power mixes over single-site installations, as they minimize supply risk and maximize geographical potential.

The study demonstrates that locations with high production variability can still contribute positively to a power portfolio, especially when other sites are underperforming. The Pareto efficiency analysis suggests a more rational and economical exploitation of wind and solar resources, revealing that selective combinations of generation sites can be as or more effective than large-scale renewable deployments.

Future directions include expanding the analysis to a broader, possibly Europe-wide region to further diversify meteorological or climatological risks. This expansion would require dimensionality-reduction methods to manage asset numbers and avoid redundancy. The study also plans to explore alternative risk and yield measures outside the classical Markowitz framework, although these approaches may pose more complex non-convex optimization challenges.

This study delves into the environmental implications of commercial-scale solar energy installations in the Southwestern United States, with a particular focus on their effects on groundwater levels, evapotranspiration rates, ecological systems, and soil integrity. It identifies several operational phase concerns, including the use of dust suppressants, water usage, and groundwater extraction, along with their ecological ramifications.

The use of various chemical dust suppressants to maintain solar panels poses potential risks to aquatic ecosystems by possibly increasing runoff and altering water chemistry, leading to higher salinity, decreased oxygen levels, and algae proliferation. Furthermore, the operational water needs of solar facilities, especially those employing wet cooling systems for steam generation, vary widely and can significantly strain water resources in already arid regions, impacting local aquatic habitats.

Groundwater withdrawal for solar operations emerges as a critical issue, with potential drawdown effects ranging dramatically based on the technology employed—from minimal impact in photovoltaic systems to severe in concentrated solar power systems using wet cooling. Such groundwater depletion could disrupt ecosystems reliant on these water sources, leading to changes in vegetation and facilitating invasive species spread.

Additionally, the study highlights ecological concerns such as the potential for solar facilities to become ecological traps for birds and aquatic insects, attracted by the polarized light from panels, resulting in increased mortality rates. The construction and operational phases of solar energy development could also lead to soil and hydrological disturbances, altering streamflow patterns, and possibly increasing wildfire risks due to vegetation loss, although these could be mitigated with appropriate planning.

Given these varied potential impacts, the study advocates for adopting an adaptive management strategy. This would entail continuous monitoring and hypothesis testing to refine management practices and policies, aiming to reduce the environmental footprint of solar energy development, particularly concerning aquatic habitats and terrestrial ecosystems.

Cuppari, R. I., Higgins, C. W., & Characklis, G. W. (2021). Agrivoltaics and weather risk: A diversification strategy for landowners. Applied Energy, 291, 116809. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116809.

This research explores the financial viability and risk mitigation potential of agrivoltaic systems (AVS), which co-locate solar power production with agriculture on the same land. By using a model incorporating stochastic weather variables and commodity prices, the study compares the net revenues from solar-only, farm-only, and agrivoltaic plots across four scenarios involving different crops and regions (alfalfa and soybeans in Oregon; soybeans and strawberries in North Carolina). The findings highlight the significant potential of agrivoltaics to increase farmers' revenues by 300–5000% compared to farm-only operations, especially for crops with high financial risk due to weather and market conditions, like strawberries. Furthermore, agrivoltaics can diversify income streams, reducing revenue volatility and potentially serving as a partial alternative to federal crop insurance.

Important findings are:

- Annual Net Revenue Increase: Co-location can boost annual net revenues relative to farm-only scenarios by 300–5000%, with significant variability depending on the crop and location.
- Risk Mitigation: For crops like strawberries, which are highly susceptible to weather and market risks, agrivoltaics can reduce revenue volatility by 48–53%, offering a more stable financial outlook.
- Financial Stability: The integration of solar power with agriculture improves financial stability during volatile weather and market conditions, benefiting from the stable revenue streams of solar power.
- Profitability and Risk Management: The study reveals that agrivoltaics not only increase profitability but also offer risk management benefits by lifting the worst-case net revenues and potentially reducing the need for crop insurance.
- Sensitivity to Crop and Location: The benefits of agrivoltaics are highly dependent on the specific crop grown and the geographical location, highlighting the importance of targeted implementation strategies.
