Dhonde, M., Sahu, K., & Murty, V. V. S. (2022). The application of solar-driven technologies for the sustainable development of agriculture farming: a comprehensive review. Reviews in Environmental Science and Bio/Technology, 21(1), 139-167. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11157-022-09611-6

This article examines the use of advanced solar energy applications in agriculture, focusing on environmental control systems such as heating, cooling, drying, lighting, irrigation, crop safety, and livestock farming. It covers a variety of solar photovoltaic (PV) applications, including solar greenhouses, dryers, pumps, desalination systems, crop protection, and solar-powered livestock farming. The study aims to deepen understanding of both passive and active solar technologies in farming, highlighting their importance for future research and rural electrification.

The article acknowledges the significant growth in solar PV systems in agriculture but emphasizes the need for more research addressing technical and economic aspects to ensure successful integration. High initial costs of PV systems, especially off-grid setups requiring energy storage, remain a barrier. Hybrid systems combining PV modules with wind turbines or other renewable sources could offer more viable and cost-effective solutions.

In conclusion, solar-PV technology integration in agriculture is extensive, reducing carbon emissions and increasing productivity. Hybrid technologies enhance creativity and flexibility in applying solar-PV technology in various farming operations. To encourage broader adoption of PV technologies, cost-effective strategies and affordable energy storage solutions are essential.
