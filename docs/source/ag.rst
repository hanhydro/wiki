This article examines the use of advanced solar energy applications in agriculture, focusing on environmental control systems such as heating, cooling, drying, lighting, irrigation, crop safety, and livestock farming. It covers a variety of solar photovoltaic (PV) applications, including solar greenhouses, dryers, pumps, desalination systems, crop protection, and solar-powered livestock farming. The study aims to deepen understanding of both passive and active solar technologies in farming, highlighting their importance for future research and rural electrification.

The article acknowledges the significant growth in solar PV systems in agriculture but emphasizes the need for more research addressing technical and economic aspects to ensure successful integration. High initial costs of PV systems, especially off-grid setups requiring energy storage, remain a barrier. Hybrid systems combining PV modules with wind turbines or other renewable sources could offer more viable and cost-effective solutions.

In conclusion, solar-PV technology integration in agriculture is extensive, reducing carbon emissions and increasing productivity. Hybrid technologies enhance creativity and flexibility in applying solar-PV technology in various farming operations. To encourage broader adoption of PV technologies, cost-effective strategies and affordable energy storage solutions are essential.

Effect of shading and light recovery on the growth, leaf structure, and photosynthetic performance of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system
Fan, Y., Chen, J., Cheng, Y., Raza, M. A., Wu, X., Wang, Z., ... & Yang, F. (2018). Effect of shading and light recovery on the growth, leaf structure, and photosynthetic performance of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system. PloS one, 13(5), e0198159. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198159

The study explored the effects of maize-induced shading on soybeans in a relay-strip intercropping setup, revealing that while shading alters soybean morphology, reduces photosynthetic activity, and changes leaf anatomy, these plants exhibit notable adaptability. Soybeans adjust by growing taller with thinner stems and show a swift rebound in photosynthetic efficiency after maize harvest when light availability increases. Despite initial growth setbacks, soybeans can compensate once full sunlight returns, suggesting that managing light exposure in intercropping systems can enhance both soybean yield and seed quality, optimizing overall agricultural productivity.

The key findings include:
Soybeans grown alongside maize experienced significant shading, which altered their growth patterns. While soybean plants grew taller under the shade of maize to reach for light, their stem diameter and aboveground biomass were reduced compared to those grown in full sunlight (sole cropping). 

Shading also affected the photosynthetic capabilities of the soybean plants. Chlorophyll content decreased under shade, reducing the photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate. However, when normal light conditions were restored after maize harvest, these photosynthetic parameters quickly rebounded.

Under shade, the thickness of the palisade and spongy tissues in soybean leaves decreased, which is indicative of adaptations to capture more light. However, after the maize was harvested and light conditions improved, the leaf anatomy of soybeans adapted again, showing increased thickness in palisade and spongy tissues, enhancing their capacity for photosynthesis.

The adaptability of soybeans to changing light conditions has implications for yield potential and seed quality, indicating that strategic management of shading in relay-strip intercropping systems could optimize crop production.

Influence of transient shade periods on the effects of drought on photosynthesis, carbohydrate accumulation and lipid peroxidation in sunflower leaves
Correia, M. J., Osório, M. L., Osório, J., Barrote, I., Martins, M., & David, M. M. (2006). Influence of transient shade periods on the effects of drought on photosynthesis, carbohydrate accumulation and lipid peroxidation in sunflower leaves. Environmental and Experimental Botany, 58(1-3), 75-84. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2005.06.015.

This study investigates the interplay between light variations, notably the intermittent shading from cloud cover, and plant responses to drought and their subsequent recovery upon rehydration. It reveals that during water scarcity, shading can serve as a protective mechanism, lessening the decline in photosynthesis rate in sunflowers and reducing oxidative stress, which in turn facilitates a quicker recovery of photosynthetic functions upon re-watering, thereby indicating that partial shade can help offset some drought effects.

The research also examines shading's role in regulating sugar levels in leaves under drought conditions, suggesting that shading may prevent the excessive accumulation of sugars that suppress photosynthetic gene activity and hinder photosynthesis. Additionally, the study notes that reduced light through shading improves leaf water potential in water-deprived plants, helping to maintain physiological functions closer to those of well-watered plants, and sees a non-significant uptick in stomatal conductance and photosynthesis in these stressed plants.

After re-watering, the immediate detrimental impacts of dry soil on photosynthesis and stomatal function appear to dissipate within 24 hours under normal growth light. Yet, plants subjected to low-light conditions post-rehydration demonstrate a significantly hindered CO2 uptake rate in comparison to consistently well-watered plants, underscoring the influence of light on photosynthetic recovery.

The findings present a nuanced picture: while transient shading generally aids water-stressed plants by counteracting drought-induced damage and maintaining photochemical efficiency, it might also impede the revival of net CO2 uptake rates after re-watering. The research underscores that the restoration of photosynthetic rates after drought stress is intricately linked to the prevailing light conditions.

The influence of shade and clouds on soil water potential: The buffered behavior of hydraulic lift
Williams, K., Caldwell, M. M., & Richards, J. H. (1993). The influence of shade and clouds on soil water potential: the buffered behavior of hydraulic lift. Plant and Soil, 157, 83-95. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02390230.

In the sagebrush/bunchgrass steppe of North America's Great Basin, this study set out to understand how shading impacts soil water potential. It was predicted that shading would improve soil water potential by lowering transpiration rates, thus reducing water use during the day and allowing for water release from roots at night. Through a combination of field experiments and modeling, the research assessed the influence of artificial shading on soil moisture.

The immediate effect of shading was a slight increase in soil water potential due to less water being used during daylight hours; nevertheless, the net impact on soil water potential was surprisingly negligible. This was explained by the necessity of daytime soil water depletion to enable nocturnal soil recharging, which was impeded by shading. Consistent with model predictions and empirical data, shading was found to decrease the daily range of soil water potential changes but did not significantly alter the overall soil water potential, suggesting a system resilience to daily evapotranspiration variations while following a stable seasonal soil water depletion pattern.

The study also observed that during minor summer rainfall events, shading could unexpectedly improve plant water status by minimizing evapotranspiration and promoting soil water redistribution in the root zone. Despite its simplicity, the model effectively illustrated the limited effect of shading on soil water potential, underscoring the crucial role of daytime water depletion in facilitating nocturnal soil rehydration.
