Fan, Y., Chen, J., Cheng, Y., Raza, M. A., Wu, X., Wang, Z., ... & Yang, F. (2018). Effect of shading and light recovery on the growth, leaf structure, and photosynthetic performance of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system. PloS one, 13(5), e0198159. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198159

The study explored the effects of maize-induced shading on soybeans in a relay-strip intercropping setup, revealing that while shading alters soybean morphology, reduces photosynthetic activity, and changes leaf anatomy, these plants exhibit notable adaptability. Soybeans adjust by growing taller with thinner stems and show a swift rebound in photosynthetic efficiency after maize harvest when light availability increases. Despite initial growth setbacks, soybeans can compensate once full sunlight returns, suggesting that managing light exposure in intercropping systems can enhance both soybean yield and seed quality, optimizing overall agricultural productivity.

The key findings include:
Soybeans grown alongside maize experienced significant shading, which altered their growth patterns. While soybean plants grew taller under the shade of maize to reach for light, their stem diameter and aboveground biomass were reduced compared to those grown in full sunlight (sole cropping). 

Shading also affected the photosynthetic capabilities of the soybean plants. Chlorophyll content decreased under shade, reducing the photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate. However, when normal light conditions were restored after maize harvest, these photosynthetic parameters quickly rebounded.

Under shade, the thickness of the palisade and spongy tissues in soybean leaves decreased, which is indicative of adaptations to capture more light. However, after the maize was harvested and light conditions improved, the leaf anatomy of soybeans adapted again, showing increased thickness in palisade and spongy tissues, enhancing their capacity for photosynthesis.

The adaptability of soybeans to changing light conditions has implications for yield potential and seed quality, indicating that strategic management of shading in relay-strip intercropping systems could optimize crop production.

Correia, M. J., Osório, M. L., Osório, J., Barrote, I., Martins, M., & David, M. M. (2006). Influence of transient shade periods on the effects of drought on photosynthesis, carbohydrate accumulation and lipid peroxidation in sunflower leaves. Environmental and Experimental Botany, 58(1-3), 75-84. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2005.06.015.

This study investigates the interplay between light variations, notably the intermittent shading from cloud cover, and plant responses to drought and their subsequent recovery upon rehydration. It reveals that during water scarcity, shading can serve as a protective mechanism, lessening the decline in photosynthesis rate in sunflowers and reducing oxidative stress, which in turn facilitates a quicker recovery of photosynthetic functions upon re-watering, thereby indicating that partial shade can help offset some drought effects.

The research also examines shading's role in regulating sugar levels in leaves under drought conditions, suggesting that shading may prevent the excessive accumulation of sugars that suppress photosynthetic gene activity and hinder photosynthesis. Additionally, the study notes that reduced light through shading improves leaf water potential in water-deprived plants, helping to maintain physiological functions closer to those of well-watered plants, and sees a non-significant uptick in stomatal conductance and photosynthesis in these stressed plants.

After re-watering, the immediate detrimental impacts of dry soil on photosynthesis and stomatal function appear to dissipate within 24 hours under normal growth light. Yet, plants subjected to low-light conditions post-rehydration demonstrate a significantly hindered CO2 uptake rate in comparison to consistently well-watered plants, underscoring the influence of light on photosynthetic recovery.

The findings present a nuanced picture: while transient shading generally aids water-stressed plants by counteracting drought-induced damage and maintaining photochemical efficiency, it might also impede the revival of net CO2 uptake rates after re-watering. The research underscores that the restoration of photosynthetic rates after drought stress is intricately linked to the prevailing light conditions.

In the sagebrush/bunchgrass steppe of North America's Great Basin, this study set out to understand how shading impacts soil water potential. It was predicted that shading would improve soil water potential by lowering transpiration rates, thus reducing water use during the day and allowing for water release from roots at night. Through a combination of field experiments and modeling, the research assessed the influence of artificial shading on soil moisture.

The immediate effect of shading was a slight increase in soil water potential due to less water being used during daylight hours; nevertheless, the net impact on soil water potential was surprisingly negligible. This was explained by the necessity of daytime soil water depletion to enable nocturnal soil recharging, which was impeded by shading. Consistent with model predictions and empirical data, shading was found to decrease the daily range of soil water potential changes but did not significantly alter the overall soil water potential, suggesting a system resilience to daily evapotranspiration variations while following a stable seasonal soil water depletion pattern.

The study also observed that during minor summer rainfall events, shading could unexpectedly improve plant water status by minimizing evapotranspiration and promoting soil water redistribution in the root zone. Despite its simplicity, the model effectively illustrated the limited effect of shading on soil water potential, underscoring the crucial role of daytime water depletion in facilitating nocturnal soil rehydration.

This study delved into how reflective aluminized polypropylene shading nets can enhance the photosynthetic performance of citrus plants in greenhouses, which are subjected to the intense heat and vapor pressure deficits characteristic of hot climates. By deploying these nets, the researchers aimed to lessen the negative impacts of such environmental conditions on photosynthesis and overall plant growth.

The installation of these reflective nets notably decreased incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and leaf temperatures, with reductions of 65% in August (winter) and 57% in November (summer), resulting in significantly cooler leaf temperatures during peak heat hours. As a consequence, shaded plants demonstrated improved stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation rates, achieving an overall 20% increase in daily net CO2 uptake compared to unshaded controls, although these gains were predominantly observed during the midday peak of PAR.

Furthermore, water use efficiency (WUE) was moderately enhanced in shaded plants, suggesting that the nets fostered a more prudent use of water. Importantly, the nets proved effective in preventing photoinhibition, maintaining healthier quantum yields and electron transport rates, thereby safeguarding the plants' photochemical systems from the stress of excess light, which unshaded plants had to regulate through transient photoinhibition.

Observations were made on 'Pera' orange nursery trees in greenhouses, with one greenhouse sheltered by the reflective net during key daylight hours. The research team utilized sophisticated instruments like a portable photosynthesis system and a PAM 2000 fluorometer to measure photosynthetic parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence.

In conclusion, the study affirmed that reflective shading nets substantially boost the photosynthetic performance and growth of citrus plants in greenhouses by enabling more efficient stomatal functioning and bolstering photochemical efficiency under challenging high light and temperature conditions. This suggests that such nets are a valuable tool in optimizing citrus plant productivity in hot, greenhouse environments.

Angmo, P., Phuntsog, N., Namgail, D., Chaurasia, O. P., & Stobdan, T. (2021). Effect of shading and high temperature amplitude in greenhouse on growth, photosynthesis, yield and phenolic contents of tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.). Physiology and Molecular Biology of Plants, 27, 1539-1546.
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12298-021-01032-z

This research evaluated the potential of cultivating tomatoes, which are sensitive to temperature changes, within a passive solar greenhouse subject to wide temperature fluctuations in a high-altitude mountainous region, and assessed the impact of incorporating a shade net with this low-cost agrarian structure.

The greenhouse itself experienced notable temperature swings, with nighttime lows averaging 6.6 °C and daytime highs reaching 39.1 °C. Despite these variations, the greenhouse's controlled environment yielded a tomato crop 1.8 times larger than that of open-field cultivation, underscoring the structure's capacity to bolster tomato production in such a volatile climate.

However, the introduction of shading reduced the extreme daytime heat by 5.6 °C but also led to a significant 48% drop in marketable yield. This was attributed to the shade's detrimental effects on photosynthesis, which caused delays in flowering and a decrease in the phenolic and flavonoid content of the tomatoes, affecting both yield and nutritional value. Soil temperatures also varied greatly, with the greenhouse and open-field conditions deviating from the optimal temperature range for tomato root zones, and shaded conditions lowering the temperature even further.

Notably, shading decreased the levels of photosynthetically active radiation inside the greenhouse to just a fraction of what was available in open fields, impeding the plants' photosynthetic efficiency. This was reflected in the nutritional content of the tomatoes, with a 29% decrease in total phenolic content and a 16% decrease in total flavonoid content under shaded conditions. The plants did adapt morphologically to the lower light levels with increased leaf area and stem height, but these changes were insufficient to offset the yield loss.

Léchaudel, M., Lopez-Lauri, F., Vidal, V., Sallanon, H., & Joas, J. (2013). Response of the physiological parameters of mango fruit (transpiration, water relations and antioxidant system) to its light and temperature environment. Journal of plant physiology, 170(6), 567-576. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2012.11.009.

This study delved into the adaptive strategies of mango fruits to diverse environmental conditions, particularly examining the effects of varying temperatures and light exposures on the fruit's water relations, skin attributes, and antioxidant defenses.

Mango fruits nestled within the canopy or exposed to direct sunlight demonstrated distinct temperature gradients, which in turn affected their transpiration rates and water conductance. The fruits exposed to the sun had adapted to reduce water conductance more so than shaded fruits, a response aimed at curbing water loss under the duress of elevated temperatures and strong sunlight.

Differences in cuticle thickness and osmotic potential were noted between fruits based on their location and exposure, with these physical changes aligning with the need to mitigate water stress and maintain osmotic equilibrium across varying environmental scenarios. In response to the heightened light exposure and consequent water stress, sun-exposed mango fruits ramped up their antioxidant systems and enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), across all stages of maturity. This was in contrast to lower enzyme activities and antioxidant levels in shaded fruit peels, with intermediate levels detected on the shaded sides of sun-exposed fruits.

Additionally, the study found increased lipid peroxidation in fruits exposed to the sun, as indicated by a rise in malondialdehyde (MDA) content, signifying oxidative stress likely spurred by intense irradiation and high temperatures. To cope with this, mango fruits have developed photoprotective strategies that facilitate the photoreduction of oxygen and the neutralization of reactive oxygen species through a coordinated network of antioxidant molecules and enzymes, a critical line of defense for sun-exposed fruits that possess limited photosynthetic abilities.

Furthermore, the research showed that both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, particularly those involved in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle and ascorbate content, were markedly elevated in the peels of sun-exposed fruits, highlighting a robust defense against the environmental stressors.

Pan, S., Liu, H., Mo, Z., Patterson, B., Duan, M., Tian, H., ... & Tang, X. (2016). Effects of nitrogen and shading on root morphologies, nutrient accumulation, and photosynthetic parameters in different rice genotypes. Scientific Reports, 6(1), 32148. https://doi.org/10.1038/srep32148.

This study examines the influence of shading and nitrogen treatments on rice growth by assessing their effects on photosynthesis, root structure, nutrient uptake, and yield outcomes. Conducted across two field experiments involving three rice cultivars, the research incorporated a range of nitrogen levels and shading intensities.

Key observations include the finding that severe shading during the crucial grain-filling stage led to a marked decrease in nutrient absorption, changes in root morphology, and a reduction in rice yields, indicating that inadequate light hampers the plant's capacity for nutrient acquisition and reproduction. High nitrogen application consistently resulted in greater yields, with the highest yields recorded at 6.70 tons per hectare in the late season of 2011, under high nitrogen conditions.

Specifically, high nitrogen availability promoted more extensive root development, as evidenced by longer total root length, larger root surface area, and greater root volume. For instance, rice plants under high nitrogen treatment exhibited a total root length of 13.09 per panicle hill with 142.10 spikelets per panicle. Conversely, heavy shading significantly detracted from root growth, with root parameters notably declining under double shading.

Photosynthetic and transpiration rates were also affected by the treatments, with the highest rates observed in the morning and the lowest at midday, especially under intense shading. The study underscored a complex interplay between nitrogen levels and light availability, with a notable interaction influencing photosynthetic rates, transpiration, and root morphology.

Furthermore, the research showed a strong positive correlation between total nitrogen and potassium accumulation with root morphological traits, reinforcing the idea that a robust root system is vital for efficient nutrient uptake in rice.

Lopez, G., Boini, A., Manfrini, L., Torres-Ruiz, J. M., Pierpaoli, E., Zibordi, M., ... & Corelli-Grappadelli, L. (2018). Effect of shading and water stress on light interception, physiology and yield of apple trees. Agricultural Water Management, 210, 140-148. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.08.015.

In a study conducted in Bologna, Italy, researchers explored the impact of net shading on apple orchards under different water stress conditions, examining how various levels of shading (20% black net, 50% red and white nets) and no netting, combined with three irrigation regimes (260 mm as control, 115 mm for moderate water stress (WS), and 50 mm for severe WS), affect apple yield, tree water status, and physiological responses. The study revealed several key insights:

Trees under net shading maintained better water status compared to those without nets, with midday stem water potential (Ψstem) around -1.0 MPa for controlled conditions, indicating a protective effect against water stress. In severe water stress situations, Ψstem values dipped to around -1.5 MPa across all netting conditions, although trees without netting experienced this decline more rapidly.

Interestingly, leaf photosynthesis rates remained stable under different shading levels but declined as water stress intensified, as indicated by more negative Ψstem values. The study found that yield was not significantly affected by shading under severe water stress conditions, with output remaining low (5–7 kg per tree). However, in moderate and control water conditions, shaded trees produced higher yields (9–13 kg per tree) than those without shade, with minimal difference observed between the degrees of shading applied.

The benefits of shading included improved tree water status, delayed fruit maturity which allows for extended growth periods, and a reduction in photo-inhibition. These findings suggest that net shading could serve as an effective tool for fruit growers to lessen the impacts of water stress, particularly in moderate and controlled water conditions. Furthermore, the research did not find significant differences in tree physiological traits or marketable yield based on the level of shading or net color, suggesting that apple trees can tolerate up to 50% light reduction.

Dong, T., Li, J., Zhang, Y., Korpelainen, H., Niinemets, Ü., & Li, C. (2015). Partial shading of lateral branches affects growth, and foliage nitrogen-and water-use efficiencies in the conifer Cunninghamia lanceolata growing in a warm monsoon climate. Tree Physiology, 35(6), 632-643. https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpv036.

This research delved into the effects of varying shading intensities on the development, structural attributes, and physiological processes of Cunninghamia lanceolata saplings, with a particular focus on how individual branches adapt to changes in light conditions. Utilizing four levels of shading (0%, 50%, 75%, and 90% reduction of full daylight), the study spanned over two growth seasons to investigate changes in several parameters, including basal stem diameter growth, leaf dry mass per unit area, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and the ratios of water-soluble to structural leaf nitrogen, alongside assessments of photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency and water-use efficiency, both instantaneous and over the long term as inferred from carbon isotope composition, across both shaded and sun-exposed branches.

The results highlighted a clear detrimental effect of shading on the growth and physiological functions of the shaded branches, with these negative impacts becoming more severe as the level of shading increased. Interestingly, branches that remained exposed to sunlight displayed a degree of compensatory behavior across most examined traits, hinting at a complex, integrated response to varying light conditions within the tree's canopy, rather than an isolated reaction to local illumination levels. This phenomenon suggests that the adaptive responses of C. lanceolata to shading are not solely determined by the immediate light environment but are also shaped by the comparative light availability across different parts of the crown.

The study posits that the observed non-autonomous responses of branches to changes in light conditions may play a crucial role in optimizing the allocation of resources throughout the entire tree. Such insights into the adaptive strategies of trees in response to light variability are invaluable for forest management practices and enhance our understanding of tree growth dynamics and ecological interactions within forest canopies. This research contributes significantly to our knowledge of how trees adjust to the heterogeneity of light environments, a key factor in forest ecology and canopy management.

This study aimed to explore how hybrids and commercial cultivars of Boehmeria nivea L. (ramie) adapt to low-light environments, focusing on two hybrids (Chuanzhu 11 and Chuanzhu 8) and two commercial cultivars (Chuanzhu 12 and Chuanzhu 6). Subjected to shade treatment over periods of 6, 12, and 18 days, notable differences emerged in the plants' responses, particularly in terms of plant traits and fiber yield, which generally declined under shade, while leaf area and plant height increased. Additionally, the study observed a significant drop in net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, suggesting a constrained ability to absorb CO2, though transpiration rates and intercellular CO2 levels remained stable. Interestingly, chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations, as well as the chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio and chlorophyll content per leaf dry mass, increased under shade, while the chlorophyll a/b ratio decreased. Among the cultivars, Chuanzhu 6 and Chuanzhu 11 demonstrated greater shade tolerance than Chuanzhu 12 and Chuanzhu 8, indicating their potential utility in management practices and breeding programs for low-light environments.

The findings have several implications for understanding and managing evapotranspiration in ramie plants under shaded conditions. The reduction in net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance under shade highlights a limitation in CO2 absorption, potentially impacting growth and yield. The unchanged transpiration rates, despite these reductions, suggest a possible mechanism in ramie to maintain water loss regulation through leaves, which is vital for plant cooling and nutrient transport. The stability of transpiration rates and intercellular CO2 levels under shade suggests a form of adaptation that decouples water loss from photosynthetic carbon dioxide uptake, indicating an adjustment in water use efficiency to conserve water without drastically affecting transpiration. The adaptive increase in leaf area and chlorophyll concentrations in response to shade is aimed at enhancing light capture for photosynthesis. This adaptation, which could increase the potential surface area for transpiration, underscores the plants' strategy to optimize light absorption and possibly manage water loss efficiently. The differential shade tolerance observed among the cultivars points to the importance of selecting varieties that can efficiently manage water use and maintain productivity in varied light conditions. Shade-tolerant cultivars like Chuanzhu 6 and Chuanzhu 11 could offer advantages in evapotranspiration management, particularly in regions with fluctuating light conditions or in intercropping systems where shading might influence ramie growth.

The research on Quercus robur seedlings presents a nuanced view of how photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD), along with water and nutrient availability and the age of the seedlings, influence their transpiration rates and overall growth. Initially, an increase in light intensity was found to boost transpiration rates, suggesting that young oaks consume more water under brighter conditions. However, this trend changes as seedlings age or acclimate to high light levels, showing a reduction in transpiration rates under similar conditions, indicating an adaptation to conserve water.

Furthermore, the study reveals that higher nutrient concentrations seem to enhance water use efficiency, as evidenced by reduced transpiration rates, possibly due to better overall plant health and more effective nutrient and water uptake systems. The availability of soil water also plays a critical role, with transpiration rates dropping in drier soil conditions, underscoring the importance of soil moisture in young oak water regulation.

Interestingly, the study highlights that the water use patterns of oak seedlings are dynamic, shaped by both their developmental stage and previous environmental conditions, such as light exposure. This dynamic suggests that oak seedlings adjust their water use strategies over time, responding to their growth needs and environmental stresses.

Water-use efficiency (WUE) in the seedlings was influenced by light levels, nutrient availability, and soil moisture, with strategic nutrient management and moderate water stress potentially improving WUE. These insights offer valuable guidance for forest regeneration efforts and nursery management, suggesting that controlling light, nutrients, and water can significantly affect young oak seedling growth and efficiency in water use.

Raz-Yaseef, N., Rotenberg, E., & Yakir, D. (2010). Effects of spatial variations in soil evaporation caused by tree shading on water flux partitioning in a semi-arid pine forest. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 150(3), 454-462. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.01.010.

In a comprehensive study conducted in the semi-arid pine forests of Southern Israel over three years, researchers delved into the dynamics of soil evaporation (E), its spatial variability, and the influencing factors, particularly focusing on the contrast between shaded and sun-exposed areas. The study illuminated the significant role of shading in modulating soil evaporation rates, which were notably lower in shaded areas, underscoring the canopy cover's effectiveness in mitigating soil moisture loss.

A pivotal aspect of the research was the strong correlation found between evaporation rates, radiation levels, and soil water content, with radiation being substantially higher in exposed areas and soil moisture patterns varying with the season—higher in exposed sites during the wet season and in shaded areas during the dry season. This relationship underscores the intricate interplay between environmental conditions and the forest's hydrological processes.

Additionally, the study provided insights into how the canopy's geometry influences the fraction of the forest floor that is shaded, considering factors such as tree height, crown width, and stand density, alongside the variability in solar altitude throughout the day. Through simulations that mapped out the relationship between evaporation rates and shaded area fraction, the researchers projected that the ratio of evaporation to precipitation (E/P) in the Yatir forest could significantly reduce as the canopy develops from sparse to full closure.

However, the research also highlighted a critical constraint on forest growth in semi-arid environments, pointing out that while a denser canopy can effectively reduce soil evaporation, it also leads to increased precipitation interception and transpiration. This dynamic suggests a threshold for sustainable forest expansion, with precipitation levels unable to support growth beyond a certain canopy cover limit, estimated at 65% for the Yatir forest.
