This article examines the use of advanced solar energy applications in agriculture, focusing on environmental control systems such as heating, cooling, drying, lighting, irrigation, crop safety, and livestock farming. It covers a variety of solar photovoltaic (PV) applications, including solar greenhouses, dryers, pumps, desalination systems, crop protection, and solar-powered livestock farming. The study aims to deepen understanding of both passive and active solar technologies in farming, highlighting their importance for future research and rural electrification.

The article acknowledges the significant growth in solar PV systems in agriculture but emphasizes the need for more research addressing technical and economic aspects to ensure successful integration. High initial costs of PV systems, especially off-grid setups requiring energy storage, remain a barrier. Hybrid systems combining PV modules with wind turbines or other renewable sources could offer more viable and cost-effective solutions.

In conclusion, solar-PV technology integration in agriculture is extensive, reducing carbon emissions and increasing productivity. Hybrid technologies enhance creativity and flexibility in applying solar-PV technology in various farming operations. To encourage broader adoption of PV technologies, cost-effective strategies and affordable energy storage solutions are essential.

Effect of shading and light recovery on the growth, leaf structure, and photosynthetic performance of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system
Fan, Y., Chen, J., Cheng, Y., Raza, M. A., Wu, X., Wang, Z., ... & Yang, F. (2018). Effect of shading and light recovery on the growth, leaf structure, and photosynthetic performance of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system.

The study explored the effects of maize-induced shading on soybeans in a relay-strip intercropping setup, revealing that while shading alters soybean morphology, reduces photosynthetic activity, and changes leaf anatomy, these plants exhibit notable adaptability. Soybeans adjust by growing taller with thinner stems and show a swift rebound in photosynthetic efficiency after maize harvest when light availability increases. Despite initial growth setbacks, soybeans can compensate once full sunlight returns, suggesting that managing light exposure in intercropping systems can enhance both soybean yield and seed quality, optimizing overall agricultural productivity.

The key findings include:
Soybeans grown alongside maize experienced significant shading, which altered their growth patterns. While soybean plants grew taller under the shade of maize to reach for light, their stem diameter and aboveground biomass were reduced compared to those grown in full sunlight (sole cropping). 

Shading also affected the photosynthetic capabilities of the soybean plants. Chlorophyll content decreased under shade, reducing the photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate. However, when normal light conditions were restored after maize harvest, these photosynthetic parameters quickly rebounded.

Under shade, the thickness of the palisade and spongy tissues in soybean leaves decreased, which is indicative of adaptations to capture more light. However, after the maize was harvested and light conditions improved, the leaf anatomy of soybeans adapted again, showing increased thickness in palisade and spongy tissues, enhancing their capacity for photosynthesis.

The adaptability of soybeans to changing light conditions has implications for yield potential and seed quality, indicating that strategic management of shading in relay-strip intercropping systems could optimize crop production.
