Fan, Y., Chen, J., Cheng, Y., Raza, M. A., Wu, X., Wang, Z., ... & Yang, F. (2018). Effect of shading and light recovery on the growth, leaf structure, and photosynthetic performance of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system. PloS one, 13(5), e0198159. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198159

The study explored the effects of maize-induced shading on soybeans in a relay-strip intercropping setup, revealing that while shading alters soybean morphology, reduces photosynthetic activity, and changes leaf anatomy, these plants exhibit notable adaptability. Soybeans adjust by growing taller with thinner stems and show a swift rebound in photosynthetic efficiency after maize harvest when light availability increases. Despite initial growth setbacks, soybeans can compensate once full sunlight returns, suggesting that managing light exposure in intercropping systems can enhance both soybean yield and seed quality, optimizing overall agricultural productivity.

The key findings include:
Soybeans grown alongside maize experienced significant shading, which altered their growth patterns. While soybean plants grew taller under the shade of maize to reach for light, their stem diameter and aboveground biomass were reduced compared to those grown in full sunlight (sole cropping). 

Shading also affected the photosynthetic capabilities of the soybean plants. Chlorophyll content decreased under shade, reducing the photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate. However, when normal light conditions were restored after maize harvest, these photosynthetic parameters quickly rebounded.

Under shade, the thickness of the palisade and spongy tissues in soybean leaves decreased, which is indicative of adaptations to capture more light. However, after the maize was harvested and light conditions improved, the leaf anatomy of soybeans adapted again, showing increased thickness in palisade and spongy tissues, enhancing their capacity for photosynthesis.

The adaptability of soybeans to changing light conditions has implications for yield potential and seed quality, indicating that strategic management of shading in relay-strip intercropping systems could optimize crop production.

Correia, M. J., Osório, M. L., Osório, J., Barrote, I., Martins, M., & David, M. M. (2006). Influence of transient shade periods on the effects of drought on photosynthesis, carbohydrate accumulation and lipid peroxidation in sunflower leaves. Environmental and Experimental Botany, 58(1-3), 75-84. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2005.06.015.

This study investigates the interplay between light variations, notably the intermittent shading from cloud cover, and plant responses to drought and their subsequent recovery upon rehydration. It reveals that during water scarcity, shading can serve as a protective mechanism, lessening the decline in photosynthesis rate in sunflowers and reducing oxidative stress, which in turn facilitates a quicker recovery of photosynthetic functions upon re-watering, thereby indicating that partial shade can help offset some drought effects.

The research also examines shading's role in regulating sugar levels in leaves under drought conditions, suggesting that shading may prevent the excessive accumulation of sugars that suppress photosynthetic gene activity and hinder photosynthesis. Additionally, the study notes that reduced light through shading improves leaf water potential in water-deprived plants, helping to maintain physiological functions closer to those of well-watered plants, and sees a non-significant uptick in stomatal conductance and photosynthesis in these stressed plants.

After re-watering, the immediate detrimental impacts of dry soil on photosynthesis and stomatal function appear to dissipate within 24 hours under normal growth light. Yet, plants subjected to low-light conditions post-rehydration demonstrate a significantly hindered CO2 uptake rate in comparison to consistently well-watered plants, underscoring the influence of light on photosynthetic recovery.

The findings present a nuanced picture: while transient shading generally aids water-stressed plants by counteracting drought-induced damage and maintaining photochemical efficiency, it might also impede the revival of net CO2 uptake rates after re-watering. The research underscores that the restoration of photosynthetic rates after drought stress is intricately linked to the prevailing light conditions.

In the sagebrush/bunchgrass steppe of North America's Great Basin, this study set out to understand how shading impacts soil water potential. It was predicted that shading would improve soil water potential by lowering transpiration rates, thus reducing water use during the day and allowing for water release from roots at night. Through a combination of field experiments and modeling, the research assessed the influence of artificial shading on soil moisture.

The immediate effect of shading was a slight increase in soil water potential due to less water being used during daylight hours; nevertheless, the net impact on soil water potential was surprisingly negligible. This was explained by the necessity of daytime soil water depletion to enable nocturnal soil recharging, which was impeded by shading. Consistent with model predictions and empirical data, shading was found to decrease the daily range of soil water potential changes but did not significantly alter the overall soil water potential, suggesting a system resilience to daily evapotranspiration variations while following a stable seasonal soil water depletion pattern.

The study also observed that during minor summer rainfall events, shading could unexpectedly improve plant water status by minimizing evapotranspiration and promoting soil water redistribution in the root zone. Despite its simplicity, the model effectively illustrated the limited effect of shading on soil water potential, underscoring the crucial role of daytime water depletion in facilitating nocturnal soil rehydration.

This study delved into how reflective aluminized polypropylene shading nets can enhance the photosynthetic performance of citrus plants in greenhouses, which are subjected to the intense heat and vapor pressure deficits characteristic of hot climates. By deploying these nets, the researchers aimed to lessen the negative impacts of such environmental conditions on photosynthesis and overall plant growth.

The installation of these reflective nets notably decreased incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and leaf temperatures, with reductions of 65% in August (winter) and 57% in November (summer), resulting in significantly cooler leaf temperatures during peak heat hours. As a consequence, shaded plants demonstrated improved stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation rates, achieving an overall 20% increase in daily net CO2 uptake compared to unshaded controls, although these gains were predominantly observed during the midday peak of PAR.

Furthermore, water use efficiency (WUE) was moderately enhanced in shaded plants, suggesting that the nets fostered a more prudent use of water. Importantly, the nets proved effective in preventing photoinhibition, maintaining healthier quantum yields and electron transport rates, thereby safeguarding the plants' photochemical systems from the stress of excess light, which unshaded plants had to regulate through transient photoinhibition.

Observations were made on 'Pera' orange nursery trees in greenhouses, with one greenhouse sheltered by the reflective net during key daylight hours. The research team utilized sophisticated instruments like a portable photosynthesis system and a PAM 2000 fluorometer to measure photosynthetic parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence.

In conclusion, the study affirmed that reflective shading nets substantially boost the photosynthetic performance and growth of citrus plants in greenhouses by enabling more efficient stomatal functioning and bolstering photochemical efficiency under challenging high light and temperature conditions. This suggests that such nets are a valuable tool in optimizing citrus plant productivity in hot, greenhouse environments.

Angmo, P., Phuntsog, N., Namgail, D., Chaurasia, O. P., & Stobdan, T. (2021). Effect of shading and high temperature amplitude in greenhouse on growth, photosynthesis, yield and phenolic contents of tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.). Physiology and Molecular Biology of Plants, 27, 1539-1546.
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12298-021-01032-z

This research evaluated the potential of cultivating tomatoes, which are sensitive to temperature changes, within a passive solar greenhouse subject to wide temperature fluctuations in a high-altitude mountainous region, and assessed the impact of incorporating a shade net with this low-cost agrarian structure.

The greenhouse itself experienced notable temperature swings, with nighttime lows averaging 6.6 °C and daytime highs reaching 39.1 °C. Despite these variations, the greenhouse's controlled environment yielded a tomato crop 1.8 times larger than that of open-field cultivation, underscoring the structure's capacity to bolster tomato production in such a volatile climate.

However, the introduction of shading reduced the extreme daytime heat by 5.6 °C but also led to a significant 48% drop in marketable yield. This was attributed to the shade's detrimental effects on photosynthesis, which caused delays in flowering and a decrease in the phenolic and flavonoid content of the tomatoes, affecting both yield and nutritional value. Soil temperatures also varied greatly, with the greenhouse and open-field conditions deviating from the optimal temperature range for tomato root zones, and shaded conditions lowering the temperature even further.

Notably, shading decreased the levels of photosynthetically active radiation inside the greenhouse to just a fraction of what was available in open fields, impeding the plants' photosynthetic efficiency. This was reflected in the nutritional content of the tomatoes, with a 29% decrease in total phenolic content and a 16% decrease in total flavonoid content under shaded conditions. The plants did adapt morphologically to the lower light levels with increased leaf area and stem height, but these changes were insufficient to offset the yield loss.
