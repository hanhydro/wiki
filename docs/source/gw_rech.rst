The study explores groundwater recharge in a semiarid loess-terrace agricultural area, focusing on the effects of long-term land-use changes. It finds that groundwater recharge in shallow-rooted grasslands is 94–100 mm annually, a rate much higher than in areas with deep-rooted vegetation. The process of annual precipitation reaching the water table in this region is slow, taking decades or centuries due to the thick unsaturated zone.

Groundwater recharge mainly occurs through vertical infiltration from July to September, with stable isotopes helping to trace this process. Land-use changes significantly impact groundwater recharge; shifting from natural ecosystems to winter wheat cultivation has reduced recharge by 42–50%, and further changing to alfalfa cultivation has almost halted it. These land-use changes result in solute accumulation in the soil, which slowly infiltrates into the groundwater, creating a delay between the increase in solute concentration in the soil and in the groundwater.

The study emphasizes that these land-use changes, leading to reduced groundwater recharge, have significant implications for the availability of regional groundwater resources. Therefore, the new state of reduced recharge should be a key consideration in regional water resource management.
