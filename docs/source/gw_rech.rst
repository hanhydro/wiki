This study, utilizing USGS and USDA data, evaluates the effect of land cover conversion on groundwater recharge in the Ogallala Aquifer region. It reveals that grassland conversion, promoted by programs like the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the USDA Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (USDA-CREP), leads to reduced groundwater recharge compared to typical crops like corn and soy in Nebraska's RRB. However, no significant difference in recharge rates is observed between grassland and common crops in Kansas's OAR.

The findings underline the importance of balancing the environmental advantages of CRP and similar programs with their regional impacts on groundwater and funding limitations. These insights can guide policymakers and agency personnel to refine CRP enrollment strategies, considering both positive and negative effects on groundwater levels from land cover changes.

The study acknowledges its focus on immediate impacts of land cover changes, with long-term effects requiring further data. It also notes limitations in the CropScape mapping, such as broad categorization of land cover types and lack of detail on land use practices, which could affect recharge rates differently. Moreover, the study doesn't factor in variable impacts of hydrologically connected groundwater.

Future research should address these limitations and could explore the effects of land cover changes on groundwater quality and identify optimal strategies for correlating groundwater level changes with local conditions. This study serves as an initial step in understanding the environmental trade-offs in programs like CRP, emphasizing the necessity to consider unintended policy impacts.

The study explores groundwater recharge in a semiarid loess-terrace agricultural area, focusing on the effects of long-term land-use changes. It finds that groundwater recharge in shallow-rooted grasslands is 94–100 mm annually, a rate much higher than in areas with deep-rooted vegetation. The process of annual precipitation reaching the water table in this region is slow, taking decades or centuries due to the thick unsaturated zone.

Groundwater recharge mainly occurs through vertical infiltration from July to September, with stable isotopes helping to trace this process. Land-use changes significantly impact groundwater recharge; shifting from natural ecosystems to winter wheat cultivation has reduced recharge by 42–50%, and further changing to alfalfa cultivation has almost halted it. These land-use changes result in solute accumulation in the soil, which slowly infiltrates into the groundwater, creating a delay between the increase in solute concentration in the soil and in the groundwater.

The study emphasizes that these land-use changes, leading to reduced groundwater recharge, have significant implications for the availability of regional groundwater resources. Therefore, the new state of reduced recharge should be a key consideration in regional water resource management.

Groundwater recharge rates and surface runoff response to land use and land cover changes in semi-arid environments. Ecological Processes, 5(1), 1-21. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13717-016-0060-6

The study reveals that land use and land cover (LULC) changes significantly impact groundwater recharge and surface runoff in semi-arid areas. Restoring bare land reduced groundwater recharge from 42% to 6-12% of incoming rainfall. The conversion of forest to other LULC types increased groundwater recharge to 3.4-7.8%, significantly so for all considered final LULC. The relationship between the Aridity Index and groundwater recharge was weak but significant, suggesting stronger changes in recharge after LULC changes in more arid environments.

Rehabilitation of bare land led to decreased surface runoff, with a reduction from 7.3% to 5.2-6.4% depending on the LULC. Conversely, converting forest to managed LULC increased surface runoff to 4.2-14.1%. Grassland conversion to forest reduced runoff from 2.5% to 1.1%. The relationship between surface runoff and the Aridity Index was weak but significant.

The study confirmed the significant effect of topsoil texture on groundwater recharge, with the highest recharges in coarse-textured soils, aligning with previous research.

In conclusion, the conversion of forests to managed LULC types results in increased groundwater recharge and surface runoff. Topsoil texture significantly influences groundwater recharge. Variability in response to LULC changes highlights the need for site-specific studies in semi-arid regions, particularly in Africa. These studies should consider multiple stressors, including LULC, climate, landscape, and soil properties, to understand the full impact of land cover changes.
