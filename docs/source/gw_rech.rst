The study investigates the AgriVoltaic Systems Development (AVSD), which allow for simultaneous electricity generation and crop growth on the same land. A key finding from quantitative research is the significant reduction in water evaporation due to AVSD. The study examined soil and pan surface evaporation under Bare soil (control treatment) (CK), Concentrated-lighting Agrivoltaic System (CAS), and Even-lighting Agrivoltaic System (EAS), using SPSS software for analysis. Results showed that both CAS and EAS notably decreased water evaporation (21-33% for soil, 14-19% for pan surface) and increased soil water content (saving 33-51%). Additionally, these systems reduced average solar radiation exposure. The study suggests that AVSD can address water scarcity, food supply, and energy production challenges concurrently.
