This study, utilizing USGS and USDA data, evaluates the effect of land cover conversion on groundwater recharge in the Ogallala Aquifer region. It reveals that grassland conversion, promoted by programs like the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the USDA Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (USDA-CREP), leads to reduced groundwater recharge compared to typical crops like corn and soy in Nebraska's RRB. However, no significant difference in recharge rates is observed between grassland and common crops in Kansas's OAR.

The findings underline the importance of balancing the environmental advantages of CRP and similar programs with their regional impacts on groundwater and funding limitations. These insights can guide policymakers and agency personnel to refine CRP enrollment strategies, considering both positive and negative effects on groundwater levels from land cover changes.

The study acknowledges its focus on immediate impacts of land cover changes, with long-term effects requiring further data. It also notes limitations in the CropScape mapping, such as broad categorization of land cover types and lack of detail on land use practices, which could affect recharge rates differently. Moreover, the study doesn't factor in variable impacts of hydrologically connected groundwater.

Future research should address these limitations and could explore the effects of land cover changes on groundwater quality and identify optimal strategies for correlating groundwater level changes with local conditions. This study serves as an initial step in understanding the environmental trade-offs in programs like CRP, emphasizing the necessity to consider unintended policy impacts.

The study introduces 'Hydroman,' a parsimonious, dynamic, spatially explicit model that simulates groundwater and surface water flow in agricultural areas, factoring in land cover and climate. Hydroman effectively models groundwater levels over time and space, validated by experts and alignment with established models and data. It helps understand the interplay between climate, land cover, and water tables, aiding in developing agricultural water management strategies.

The study finds that while climate is a primary factor, land use changes, like the shift from cattle ranching to grain crops, significantly affect the region's water balance. Double cropping can mitigate flooding risks by extending water absorption periods, but may be challenging in waterlogged areas.

Adaptive farming strategies can reduce flooding risks, but their effectiveness depends on accurate environmental information and spatial precision. In highly variable landscapes, strict crop rotation might be more effective. In extreme conditions, adaptation strategies may not prevent flooding, suggesting that reverting partially to pasture, especially in low-lying areas, could stabilize the system.

Future work with Hydroman includes exploring management strategies that consider decisions in neighboring plots, addressing coordination challenges. This could lead to recommendations for pasture allocation to reduce flooding risks, considering the varying impacts on different stakeholders. The study advocates for collaborative approaches using models like Hydroman to enhance the adaptive capacity, resilience, and sustainability of human-natural systems.

The study examines the impact of irrigation and land use changes on groundwater recharge in the Northern Great Lakes region, focusing on the WCS landscape where over 14% is irrigated cropland. It finds that climate variability, cropping systems, and soil texture are key factors influencing groundwater recharge. In an average growing season, irrigated sweet corn and potato rotations increase aquifer recharge, whereas irrigated field corn and pea–pearl millet rotations decrease it. Crop residue removal post-harvest to boost recharge is not feasible in WCS due to soil erosion risks and challenges in establishing cover crops.

The study also highlights that potato cropping systems, while recharging the aquifer in an average year, pose a potential risk to groundwater quality. The impact of WCS irrigated agriculture on freshwater resources varies annually due to crop rotations and precipitation differences. Accurate prediction of these impacts requires process-based models that explicitly represent crop rotations, considering factors like market trends, pest management, and climate.

Additionally, the study used replicated passive capillary lysimetry and soil moisture sensors to assess water budget variability across cropping systems. However, this method may overestimate drainage in sandy soils, suggesting the need for future research using different methods like equilibrium tension lysimetry, aerial remote sensing, or eddy covariance, to ensure accurate water resource management in the WCS.

The study explores groundwater recharge in a semiarid loess-terrace agricultural area, focusing on the effects of long-term land-use changes. It finds that groundwater recharge in shallow-rooted grasslands is 94–100 mm annually, a rate much higher than in areas with deep-rooted vegetation. The process of annual precipitation reaching the water table in this region is slow, taking decades or centuries due to the thick unsaturated zone.

Groundwater recharge mainly occurs through vertical infiltration from July to September, with stable isotopes helping to trace this process. Land-use changes significantly impact groundwater recharge; shifting from natural ecosystems to winter wheat cultivation has reduced recharge by 42–50%, and further changing to alfalfa cultivation has almost halted it. These land-use changes result in solute accumulation in the soil, which slowly infiltrates into the groundwater, creating a delay between the increase in solute concentration in the soil and in the groundwater.

The study emphasizes that these land-use changes, leading to reduced groundwater recharge, have significant implications for the availability of regional groundwater resources. Therefore, the new state of reduced recharge should be a key consideration in regional water resource management.

Groundwater recharge rates and surface runoff response to land use and land cover changes in semi-arid environments. Ecological Processes, 5(1), 1-21. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13717-016-0060-6

The study reveals that land use and land cover (LULC) changes significantly impact groundwater recharge and surface runoff in semi-arid areas. Restoring bare land reduced groundwater recharge from 42% to 6-12% of incoming rainfall. The conversion of forest to other LULC types increased groundwater recharge to 3.4-7.8%, significantly so for all considered final LULC. The relationship between the Aridity Index and groundwater recharge was weak but significant, suggesting stronger changes in recharge after LULC changes in more arid environments.

Rehabilitation of bare land led to decreased surface runoff, with a reduction from 7.3% to 5.2-6.4% depending on the LULC. Conversely, converting forest to managed LULC increased surface runoff to 4.2-14.1%. Grassland conversion to forest reduced runoff from 2.5% to 1.1%. The relationship between surface runoff and the Aridity Index was weak but significant.

The study confirmed the significant effect of topsoil texture on groundwater recharge, with the highest recharges in coarse-textured soils, aligning with previous research.

In conclusion, the conversion of forests to managed LULC types results in increased groundwater recharge and surface runoff. Topsoil texture significantly influences groundwater recharge. Variability in response to LULC changes highlights the need for site-specific studies in semi-arid regions, particularly in Africa. These studies should consider multiple stressors, including LULC, climate, landscape, and soil properties, to understand the full impact of land cover changes.

The study finds that on-farm recharge is a viable option for the study area. Utilizing 134,000 acres of cropland could enable approximately 3900 thousand acre-feet (TAF) of recharge over 20 years. However, diminishing returns are expected due to the variability of available water, variations in infiltration rates, and recharged water leaving the groundwater system. Modifying berm heights on croplands with higher infiltration rates and adding gravel pits in high-infiltration areas could increase total recharge to about 5,400 TAF.

The study's methodology is adaptable for additional data, such as soil hydraulic conductivity, geology, infiltration testing, field drainage rates, flooding tolerance of different crops, and specific site costs, including use fees and infrastructure improvements.

Future work could consider financial aspects, groundwater quality protection, support for the Cosumnes River baseflow, and diverse recharge facility types. Continued stakeholder collaboration is crucial for further insights.
